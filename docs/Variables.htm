<span id="Variables"></span><h2 id="Intro">Variables</h2>
<p>See <a href="Concepts.htm#variables">Variables</a> for general explanation and details about how variables work.</p>
<p id="assigning"><strong>Storing values in variables</strong>: To store a string or number in a variable, use the <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">colon-equal operator (:=)</a> followed by a number, quoted string or any other type of <a href="Language.htm#expressions">expression</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>MyNumber := 123
MyString := &quot;This is a literal string.&quot;
CopyOfVar := Var</pre>
<p>Variables which have not been assigned a value contain an empty string by default. Therefore, to erase the contents of a variable, simply assign an empty string:</p>
<pre>MyVar := &quot;&quot;</pre>
<p>A variable can also be assigned a value indirectly, by using it as an <em>output variable</em> of a function. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a> <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong></pre>
<p id="retrieving"><strong>Retrieving the contents of variables</strong>: To include the contents of a variable in a string, use <a href="#concat">concatenation</a> or <a href="commands/Format.htm">Format</a>. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> "The value of Var is " . Var . "."
MsgBox "The value in the variable named Var is " Var "."
MsgBox Format("Var has the value {1}.", Var)
</pre>
<p>Sub-expressions can be combined with strings in the same way. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox(&quot;The sum of X and Y is &quot; . (X + Y))
</pre>
<p><strong>Comparing variables</strong>: Please read the expressions section below for important notes about the different kinds of comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="Expressions">Expressions</h2>
<p class="note">See <a href="Language.htm#expressions">Expressions</a> for a structured overview and further explanation.</p>
<p>Expressions are used to perform one or more operations upon a series of variables, literal strings, and/or literal numbers.</p>
<p>Plain words in expressions are interpreted as variable names. Consequently, literal strings must be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them from variables. For example:</p>
<pre>if (CurrentSetting &gt; 100 or FoundColor != &quot;Blue&quot;)
    MsgBox "The setting is too high or the wrong color is present."</pre>
<p>In the example above, &quot;Blue&quot; appears in quotes because it is a literal string. Single-quote marks (&apos;) and double-quote marks (&quot;) function identically, except that a string enclosed in single-quote marks can contain literal double-quote marks and vice versa. Therefore, to include an <em>actual</em> quote mark inside a literal string, <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape</a> the quote mark or enclose the string in the opposite type of quote mark. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox &quot;She said, <span class="red">`&quot;</span>An apple a day.<span class="red">`&quot;</span>&quot;
MsgBox <span class="red">&apos;</span>She said, &quot;An apple a day.&quot;<span class="red">&apos;</span></pre>
<p><strong>Empty strings</strong>: To specify an empty string in an expression, use an empty pair of quotes. For example, the statement <code>if (MyVar != &quot;&quot;)</code> would be true if <em>MyVar</em> is not blank.</p>
<p><strong>Storing the result of an expression</strong>: To assign a result to a variable, use the <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">:= operator</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>NetPrice := Price * (1 - Discount/100)</pre>
<p id="Boolean"><strong>Boolean values</strong>: When an expression is required to evaluate to true or false (such as an IF-statement), a blank or zero result is considered false and all other results are considered true. For example, the statement <code>if ItemCount</code> would be false only if ItemCount is blank or 0. Similarly, the expression <code>if not ItemCount</code> would yield the opposite result.</p>
<p>Operators such as NOT/&gt;/=/&lt; automatically produce a true or false value: they yield 1 for true and 0 for false. However, the AND/OR operators always produce one of the input values. For example, in the following expression, the variable <em>Done</em> is assigned 1 if A_Index is greater than 5 or the value of <em>FoundIt</em> in all other cases:</p>
<pre>Done := A_Index &gt; 5 or FoundIt</pre>
<p>As hinted above, a variable can be used to hold a false value simply by making it blank or assigning 0 to it. To take advantage of this, the shorthand statement <code>if Done</code> can be used to check whether the variable Done is true or false.</p>
<p><span id="True"></span><span id="False"></span>In an expression, the keywords <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> resolve to 1 and 0. They can be used to make a script more readable as in these examples:</p>
<pre>CaseSensitive := false
ContinueSearch := true</pre>
<p id="numbers"><strong>Integers and floating point</strong>: Within an expression, numbers are considered to be floating point if they contain a decimal point or scientific notation; otherwise, they are integers. For most operators -- such as addition and multiplication -- if either of the inputs is a floating point number, the result will also be a floating point number.</p>
<p>Within expressions and non-expressions alike, integers may be written in either hexadecimal or decimal format. Hexadecimal numbers all start with the prefix 0x. For example, <code>Sleep 0xFF</code> is equivalent to <code>Sleep 255</code>. Floating point numbers can optionally be written in scientific notation, with or without a decimal point (e.g. <code>1e4</code> or <code>-2.1E-4</code>).</p>
<p>Within expressions, unquoted literal numbers such as <code>128</code>, <code>0x7F</code> and <code>1.0</code> are converted to pure numbers before the script begins executing, so converting the number to a string may produce a value different to the original literal value. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox(0x7F)  <em>; Shows 128</em>
MsgBox(1.00)  <em>; Shows 1.0</em></pre>

<h2 id="Operators">Operators in Expressions</h2>
<p class="note">See <a href="Language.htm#operators">Operators</a> for general information about operators.</p>
<p>Except where noted below, any blank value (empty string) or non-numeric value involved in a math operation is <strong>not</strong> assumed to be zero. Instead, an exception is thrown. If <a href="commands/Try.htm">Try</a> is not used, the unhandled exception causes an error dialog by default.</p>

<h3 id="operators">Expression Operators (in descending precedence order)</h3>
<table class="info">
  <tr id="ref">
    <td style="text-align:center; white-space:nowrap"><strong>%Expr%</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p>Evaluates the sub-expression <em>Expr</em> and uses its value as the name or partial name of a variable, function, property or method. This allows the script to refer to a variable, function, property or method whose name is not written literally in the script, but is determined by evaluating <em>Expr</em>, which is typically another variable. Percent signs cannot be used directly within <em>Expr</em> due to ambiguity, but can be nested within parentheses. Otherwise, <em>Expr</em> can be any expression.</p>
      <p>If there are any adjoining <em>%Expr%</em> sequences and partial <a href="Concepts.htm#names">names</a> (without any spaces or other characters between them), they are combined to form a single name.</p>
      <p><code>%Expr%()</code> performs a <a href="Functions.htm#DynCall">dynamic function call</a>.</p>
      <p><code>x.%Expr%</code> accesses a property of object <em>x</em> and <code>x.%Expr%()</code> calls a method.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, <code>%Expr%</code> dynamically retrieves a variable by name. The <u>result</u> of the sub-expression <em>Expr</em> must be the name or partial name of the variable to be retrieved.</p>
      <p>If the variable does not already exist, a blank variable is created. An <a href="commands/Throw.htm#Exception">exception</a> is thrown if the name is <a href="Concepts.htm#names">invalid</a>.</p>
      <p>This is most commonly used to reference <a href="misc/Arrays.htm#pseudo">pseudo-array</a> elements.</p>
      <p>Although this is historically known as a "double-deref", this term is inaccurate when <em>Expr</em> does not contain a variable (first deref), and also when the resulting variable is the target of an assignment, not being dereferenced (second deref).</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="objdot">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>x.y</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Member access</strong>. Get or set a value or call a method of object <i>x</i>, where <i>y</i> is a literal name. See <a href="Objects.htm#Usage_Objects">object syntax</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="IncDec">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>++<br>
    --</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Pre- and post-increment/decrement</strong>. Adds or subtracts 1 from a variable. The operator may appear either before or after the variable's name. If it appears <em>before</em> the name, the operation is performed and its result is used by the next operation (the result is a variable reference in this case). For example, <code>Var := ++X</code> increments X and then assigns its value to <em>Var</em>. Conversely, if the operator appears <em>after</em> the variable's name, the result is the value of X prior to performing the operation. For example, <code>Var := X++</code> increments X but <em>Var</em> receives the value X had before it was incremented.</p>
      <p>These operators can also be used with a property of an object, such as <code>myArray.Length++</code> or <code>--myArray[i]</code>. In these cases, the result of the sub-expression is always a number, not a variable reference.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="pow">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>**</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Power</strong>. Example usage: <code>base**exponent</code>. Both <em>base</em> and <em>exponent</em> may contain a decimal point. If <em>exponent</em> is negative, the result  will be formatted as a floating point number even if <em>base</em> and <em>exponent</em> are both integers. Since ** is of higher precedence than unary minus, <code>-2**2</code> is evaluated like <code>-(2**2)</code> and so yields -4. Thus, to raise a literal negative number to a power, enclose it in parentheses such as <code>(-2)**2</code>.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A negative <em>base</em> combined with a fractional <em>exponent</em> such as <code>(-2)**0.5</code> is not supported; attempting it will cause an exception to be thrown. But both <code>(-2)**2</code> and <code>(-2)**2.0</code> are supported. If both <em>base</em> and <em>exponent</em> are 0, the result is undefined and an exception is thrown.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="unary">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>-<br>
    !<br>
    ~</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Unary minus (-)</strong>: Inverts the sign of its operand.</p>
      <p><strong>Unary plus (+)</strong>: <code>+N</code> is equivalent to <code>-(-N)</code>. This has no effect when applied to a pure number, but can be used to convert numeric strings to pure numbers.</p>
      <p><strong>Logical-not (!)</strong>: If the operand is blank or 0, the result of applying logical-not is 1, which means &quot;true&quot;. Otherwise, the result is 0 (false). For example: <code>!x or !(y and z)</code>. Note: The word NOT is synonymous with <strong>!</strong> except that <strong>!</strong> has a higher precedence. Consecutive unary operators such as <code><strong>!!</strong>Var</code> are allowed because they are evaluated in right-to-left order.</p>
      <p><strong>Bitwise-not (~)</strong>: This inverts each bit of its operand. If the operand is a floating point value, it is truncated to an integer prior to the calculation. As 64-bit signed integers are used, a positive input value will always give a negative result and vice versa. For example, <code>~0xf0f</code> evaluates to -0xf10 (-3856), which is binary equivalent to 0xfffffffffffff0f0. If an unsigned 32-bit value is intended, the result can be truncated with <code><i>result</i> &amp; 0xffffffff</code>.</p>
    </td>

  <tr id="MulDiv">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>*<br>

    //
    </strong></td>
    <td><p><strong>Multiply (*)</strong>: The result is an integer if both inputs are integers; otherwise, it is a floating point number.</p>
      <p><strong>Other uses</strong>: The asterisk (*) symbol is also used in <a href="Functions.htm#VariadicCall">variadic function calls</a>.</p>
      <p id="divide"><strong>True divide (/)</strong>: True division yields a floating point result even when both inputs are integers. For example, <code>3/2</code> yields 1.5 rather than 1, and <code>4/2</code> yields 2.0 rather than 2.</p>
      <p id="FloorDivide"><strong>Floor divide (//)</strong>: The double-slash operator uses high-performance integer division if the two inputs are integers. For example, <code>5//3</code> is 1 and <code>5//-3</code> is -1. If either of the inputs is in floating point format, floating point division is performed and the result is truncated to the nearest integer to the left. For example, <code>5//3.0</code> is 1.0 and <code>5.0//-3</code> is -2.0. Although the result of this floating point division is an integer, it is stored in floating point format so that anything else that uses it will see it as such. For modulo, see <a href="commands/Math.htm#Mod">Mod</a>.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#AssignOp">*= and /= operators</a> are a shorthand way to multiply or divide the value in a variable by another value. For example, <code>Var*=2</code> produces the same result as <code>Var:=Var*2</code> (though the former performs better).</p>
    <p>Division by zero causes an exception to be thrown.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="AddSub">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>+<br>
    -</strong></td>
    <td><p><strong>Add (+)</strong> and <strong>subtract (-)</strong>. On a related note, the <a href="#AssignOp">+= and -= operators</a> are a shorthand way to increment or decrement a variable. For example, <code>Var+=2</code> produces the same result as <code>Var:=Var+2</code> (though the former performs better). Similarly, a variable can be increased or decreased by 1 by using <a href="#IncDec">Var++, Var--, ++Var, or --Var</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Other uses</strong>: If the + or - symbol is not preceded by a value (or a sub-expression which yields a value), it is interpreted as a <a href="#unary">unary operator</a> instead.</p>

    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>&lt;&lt;<br>
    &gt;&gt;</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Bit shift left (&lt;&lt;)</strong> and <strong>right (&gt;&gt;)</strong>. Example usage: <code>Value1 &lt;&lt; Value2</code>. Any floating point input is truncated to an integer prior to the calculation. Shift left (<strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>) is equivalent to multiplying <em>Value1</em> by &quot;2 to the <em>Value2</em>th power&quot;. Shift right (<strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>) is equivalent to dividing <em>Value1</em> by &quot;2 to the <em>Value2</em>th power&quot; and rounding the result to the nearest integer leftward on the number line; for example, <code>-3&gt;&gt;1</code> is -2. If <em>Value2</em> is less than 0 or greater than 63 (after truncation) an exception is thrown.</td>

    <td>
      <p><strong>Bitwise-and (&amp;)</strong>, <strong>bitwise-exclusive-or (^)</strong>, and <strong>bitwise-or (|)</strong>. Of the three, <strong>&amp;</strong> has the highest precedence and <strong>|</strong> has the lowest. Any floating point input is truncated to an integer prior to the calculation.</p>
      <p>Related: <a href="#unary">Bitwise-not (~)</a></p>
      <p><strong>Other uses</strong>: If the &amp; symbol is not preceded by a value (or a sub-expression which yields a value), it is interpreted as the <a href="#unary">address operator</a> instead.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="concat">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>.</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Concatenate</strong>. A period (dot) with at least one space or tab on each side is used to combine two items into a single string. You may also omit the period to achieve the same result (except where ambiguous such as <code>x <strong>-</strong>y</code>, or when the item on the right side has a leading ++ or --). When the dot is omitted, there must be at least one space or tab between the items to be merged.</p>
      <pre>Var := "The color is " <strong>.</strong> FoundColor  <em>; Explicit concat</em>
Var := "The color is " FoundColor    <em>; Auto-concat</em>
</pre>
      <p>Sub-expressions can also be concatenated. For example: <code>Var := "The net price is " <strong>.</strong>  Price * (1 - Discount/100)</code>.</p>
      <p>A line that begins with a period (or any other operator) is automatically <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">appended to</a> the line above it.</p>
      <p>The entire <a href="commands/StrLen.htm">length</a> of each input is used, even if it includes binary zero. For example, <code>Chr(0x2010) Chr(0x0000) Chr(0x4030)</code> produces the following string of bytes (due to UTF-16-LE encoding): 0x10, 0x20, 0, 0, 0x30, 0x40. The result has an additional null-terminator (binary zero) which is not included in the length.</p>
      <p><strong>Other uses</strong>: If there is no space or tab to the right of a period (dot), it is interpreted as either a literal <a href="#numbers">floating-point number</a> or <a href="#objdot">member access</a>. For example, <code>1.1</code> and <code>(.5)</code> are numbers, <code>A_Args.Has(3)</code> is a method call and <code>A_Args.Length</code> is a property access.</p>

  <tr id="regex">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>~=</strong></td>

  </tr>
  <tr id="compare">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<br>
    &gt;= &lt;=</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Greater (&gt;)</strong>, <strong>less (&lt;)</strong>, <strong>greater-or-equal (&gt;=)</strong>, and <strong>less-or-equal (&lt;=)</strong>. If either of the inputs is not numeric (or both are strings), they are compared alphabetically. For example, 2 &lt; &quot;10&quot; is <em>true</em> whereas &quot;2&quot; &lt; &quot;10&quot; is <em>false</em>. The comparison is case sensitive only if <a href="commands/StringCaseSense.htm">StringCaseSense</a> has been turned on. See also: <a href="commands/Sort.htm">Sort</a></p>
      <p>When comparing strings, these operators compare only up to the first binary zero.</p>

    <td>
      <p><strong>Case-insensitive equal (=) / not-equal (!=)</strong> and <strong>case-sensitive equal (==) / not-equal (!==)</strong>. The <strong>==</strong> operator behaves identically to <strong>=</strong> except when either of the inputs is not numeric (or both are strings), in which case <strong>==</strong> is always case sensitive and <strong>=</strong> is always case insensitive (the method of insensitivity depends on <a href="commands/StringCaseSense.htm">StringCaseSense</a>). The <strong>!=</strong> and <strong>!==</strong> behave identically to their counterparts without <strong>!</strong>, except that the result is inverted.</p>
      <p>The <strong>==</strong> and <strong>!==</strong> operators can be used to compare strings which contain binary zero. All other comparison operators except <strong>~=</strong> compare only up to the first binary zero.</p>

    </td>
    <td><p><strong>Assign</strong>. Performs an operation on the contents of a variable and stores the result back in the same variable. The simplest assignment operator is <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">colon-equals (:=)</a>, which stores the result of an expression in a variable. For a description of what the other operators do, see their related entries in this table. For example, <code>Var //= 2</code> performs <a href="#FloorDivide">floor division</a> to divide <em>Var</em> by 2, then stores the result back in <em>Var</em>. Similarly, <code>Var <strong>.=</strong> &quot;abc&quot;</code> is a shorthand way of writing <code>Var := Var <strong>.</strong> &quot;abc&quot;</code>.</p>
      <p>Unlike most other operators, assignments are evaluated from right to left. Consequently, a line such as <code>Var1 := Var2 := 0</code> first assigns 0 to <em>Var2</em> then assigns <em>Var2</em> to <em>Var1</em>.</p>
    <p>If an assignment is used as the input for some other operator, its value is the variable itself. For example,  the expression <code>(Var+=2) &gt; 50</code> is true if the newly-increased value in <em>Var</em> is greater than 50. This also allows an assignment to be passed <a href="Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef</a>, or its address taken; for example: <code>StrPtr(x:=&quot;abc&quot;)</code>.</p>
    <p>The precedence of the assignment operators is automatically raised when it would avoid a syntax error or provide more intuitive behavior. For example: <code>not x:=y</code> is evaluated as <code>not (x:=y)</code>. Similarly, <code>++Var := X</code> is evaluated as <code>++(Var := X)</code>; and <code>Z&gt;0 ? X:=2 : Y:=2</code> is evaluated as <code>Z&gt;0 ? (X:=2) : (Y:=2)</code>.</p>
    <p>An assignment can also target a property of an object, such as <code>myArray.Length += n</code> or <code>myArray[i] .= t</code>. When assigning to a property, the result of the sub-expression is the value being assigned, not a variable reference.</p>

    <td><strong>() =&gt;</strong> <em>expr</em></td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Fat arrow function</strong>. Defines a simple <a href="Functions.htm">function</a> and returns a <a href="objects/Func.htm">Func</a> or <a href="Functions.htm#closures">Closure</a> object. Write the function's <a href="Functions.htm#param">parameter list</a> (optionally preceded by a function name) to the left of the operator. When the function is called (via the returned reference), it evaluates the sub-expression <em>expr</em> and returns the result.</p>
      <p>The following two examples are equivalent:</p>
      <pre>sumfn := Sum(a, b) =&gt; a + b</pre>
      <pre>Sum(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
sumfn := Func("Sum")</pre>
      <p>In both cases, the function is defined <strong>unconditionally</strong> at the moment the script launches, but the function reference is stored in <em>sumfn</em> only if and when the assignment is evaluated.</p>
      <p>If the function name is omitted and the parameter list consists of only a single parameter name, the parentheses can be omitted. The example below defines an anonymous function with one parameter <code>a</code> and stores its reference in the variable <code>double</code>:</p>
      <pre>double := a =&gt; a * 2</pre>
      <p>Variable references in <em>expr</em> are resolved in the same way as in the equivalent full function definition. For instance, <em>expr</em> may refer to an outer function's local variables (as in any <a href="Functions.htm#nested">nested function</a>), in which case a new <a href="Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> is created and returned each time the fat arrow expression is evaluated. The function is <a href="Functions.htm#AssumeLocal">assume-local</a> if it is nested inside another function, otherwise it is <a href="Functions.htm#AssumeGlobal">assume-global</a>.</p>
      <p>Specifying a name for the function allows it to be called recursively or by other nested functions without storing a reference to the <a href="Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> within itself (thereby creating a problematic <a href="Objects.htm#Circular_References">circular reference</a>). It can also be helpful for debugging, such with <a href="objects/Func.htm#Name">Func.Name</a> or when displayed on the debugger's call stack.</p>
      <p>Fat arrow syntax can also be used to define shorthand <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_property_short">properties</a> and <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_method">methods</a>.</p>

    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>,</strong></td>
    <td><p><strong>Comma (multi-statement)</strong>. Commas may be used to write multiple sub-expressions on a single line. This is most commonly used to group together multiple assignments or function calls.  For example: <code>x:=1<strong>,</strong> y+=2<strong>,</strong> ++index, MyFunc()</code>. Such statements are executed in order from left to right.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A line that begins with a comma (or any other operator) is automatically <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">appended to</a> the line above it. See also: <a href="#CommaPerf">comma performance</a>.</p>
      <p>Comma is also used to delimit the parameters of a function call or control flow statement. To include a multi-statement expression in a parameter list, enclose it in an extra set of parentheses. For example, <code>MyFn((x, y))</code> evaluates both x and y but passes y as the first and only parameter of MyFn.</p>

This typically corresponds to an array element or item within a collection, where <em>y</em> is the item's index or key. The item can be assigned a value by using any <a href="#AssignOp">assignment operator</a> immediately after the closing bracket. For example, <code>x[y] := z</code>.</p>

<p id="CommaPerf"><strong>Performance</strong>: The comma operator is usually faster than writing separate expressions, especially when assigning one variable to another (e.g. <code>x:=y, a:=b</code>). Performance continues to improve as more and more expressions are combined into a single expression; for example, it may be 35% faster to combine five or ten simple expressions into a single expression.</p>
