<span id="Variables"></span><h2 id="Intro">Variables</h2>
<p>See <a href="Concepts.htm#variables">Variables</a> for general explanation and details about how variables work.</p>
<p id="assigning"><strong>Storing values in variables</strong>: To store a string or number in a variable, use the <a href="#AssignOp">colon-equal operator (:=)</a> followed by a number, quoted string or any other type of <a href="Language.htm#expressions">expression</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>MyNumber := 123
MyString := "This is a literal string."
CopyOfVar := Var</pre>
<p>A variable cannot be explicitly deleted, but its previous value can be released by assigning a new value, such as an empty string:</p>
<pre>MyVar := ""</pre>
<p>A variable can also be assigned a value indirectly, by <a href="#ref">taking its reference</a> and using a <a href="#deref">double-deref</a> or passing it to a function. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a> &amp;x, &amp;y</pre>
<p>Reading the value of a variable which has not been assigned a value is considered an error. <a href="commands/IsSet.htm">IsSet</a> can be used to detect this condition.</p>
<p id="retrieving"><strong>Retrieving the contents of variables</strong>: To include the contents of a variable in a string, use <a href="#concat">concatenation</a> or <a href="commands/Format.htm">Format</a>. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> "The value of Var is " . Var . "."
MsgBox "The value in the variable named Var is " Var "."
MsgBox Format("Var has the value {1}.", Var)
</pre>
<p>Sub-expressions can be combined with strings in the same way. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox("The sum of X and Y is " . (X + Y))
</pre>
<p><strong>Comparing variables</strong>: Please read the expressions section below for important notes about the different kinds of comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="Expressions">Expressions</h2>
<p class="note">See <a href="Language.htm#expressions">Expressions</a> for a structured overview and further explanation.</p>
<p>Expressions are used to perform one or more operations upon a series of variables, literal strings, and/or literal numbers.</p>
<p>Plain words in expressions are interpreted as variable names. Consequently, literal strings must be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them from variables. For example:</p>
<pre>if (CurrentSetting &gt; 100 or FoundColor != "Blue")
    MsgBox "The setting is too high or the wrong color is present."</pre>
<p>In the example above, "Blue" appears in quotes because it is a literal string. Single-quote marks (&apos;) and double-quote marks (") function identically, except that a string enclosed in single-quote marks can contain literal double-quote marks and vice versa. Therefore, to include an <em>actual</em> quote mark inside a literal string, <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape</a> the quote mark or enclose the string in the opposite type of quote mark. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox "She said, <span class="red">`"</span>An apple a day.<span class="red">`"</span>"
MsgBox <span class="red">&apos;</span>She said, "An apple a day."<span class="red">&apos;</span></pre>
<p><strong>Empty strings</strong>: To specify an empty string in an expression, use an empty pair of quotes. For example, the statement <code>if (MyVar != "")</code> would be true if <em>MyVar</em> is not blank.</p>
<p><strong>Storing the result of an expression</strong>: To assign a result to a variable, use the <a href="#AssignOp">:= operator</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>NetPrice := Price * (1 - Discount/100)</pre>
<p id="Boolean"><strong>Boolean values</strong>: When an expression is required to evaluate to true or false (such as an IF-statement), a blank or zero result is considered false and all other results are considered true. For example, the statement <code>if ItemCount</code> would be false only if ItemCount is blank or 0. Similarly, the expression <code>if not ItemCount</code> would yield the opposite result.</p>
<p>Operators such as NOT/&gt;/=/&lt; automatically produce a true or false value: they yield 1 for true and 0 for false. However, the AND/OR operators always produce one of the input values. For example, in the following expression, the variable <em>Done</em> is assigned 1 if A_Index is greater than 5 or the value of <em>FoundIt</em> in all other cases:</p>
<pre>Done := A_Index &gt; 5 or FoundIt</pre>
<p>As hinted above, a variable can be used to hold a false value simply by making it blank or assigning 0 to it. To take advantage of this, the shorthand statement <code>if Done</code> can be used to check whether the variable Done is true or false.</p>
<p><span id="True"></span><span id="False"></span>In an expression, the keywords <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> resolve to 1 and 0. They can be used to make a script more readable as in these examples:</p>
<pre>CaseSensitive := false
ContinueSearch := true</pre>
<p id="numbers"><strong>Integers and floating point</strong>: Within an expression, numbers are considered to be floating point if they contain a decimal point or scientific notation; otherwise, they are integers. For most operators -- such as addition and multiplication -- if either of the inputs is a floating point number, the result will also be a floating point number.</p>
<p>Within expressions and non-expressions alike, integers may be written in either hexadecimal or decimal format. Hexadecimal numbers all start with the prefix 0x. For example, <code>Sleep 0xFF</code> is equivalent to <code>Sleep 255</code>. Floating point numbers can optionally be written in scientific notation, with or without a decimal point (e.g. <code>1e4</code> or <code>-2.1E-4</code>).</p>
<p>Within expressions, unquoted literal numbers such as <code>128</code>, <code>0x7F</code> and <code>1.0</code> are converted to pure numbers before the script begins executing, so converting the number to a string may produce a value different to the original literal value. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox(0x7F)  <em>; Shows 128</em>
MsgBox(1.00)  <em>; Shows 1.0</em></pre>

<h2 id="Operators">Operators in Expressions</h2>
<p class="note">See <a href="Language.htm#operators">Operators</a> for general information about operators.</p>
<p>Except where noted below, any blank value (empty string) or non-numeric value involved in a math operation is <strong>not</strong> assumed to be zero. Instead, a <a href="objects/Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> is thrown. If <a href="commands/Try.htm">Try</a> is not used, the unhandled exception causes an error dialog by default.</p>

    <td>
      <p><strong>Dereference</strong> or <strong>name substitution</strong>.</p>
      <p>When <em>Expr</em> evaluates to a <a href="Concepts.htm#variable-references">VarRef</a>, <code>%Expr%</code> accesses the corresponding variable. For example, <code>x := &amp;y</code> takes a reference to <em>y</em> and assigns it to <em>x</em>, then <code>%x% := 1</code> assigns to the variable <em>y</em> and <code>%x%</code> reads its value.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the value of the sub-expression <em>Expr</em> is used as the name or partial name of a variable or property. This allows the script to refer to a variable or property whose name is determined by evaluating <em>Expr</em>, which is typically another variable. Variables cannot be created dynamically, but a variable can be assigned dynamically if it has been declared or referenced non-dynamically somewhere in the script.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <u>result</u> of the sub-expression <em>Expr</em> must be the name or partial name of the variable or property to be accessed.</p>
      <p>Percent signs cannot be used directly within <em>Expr</em> due to ambiguity, but can be nested within parentheses. Otherwise, <em>Expr</em> can be any expression.</p>
      <p>If there are any adjoining <em>%Expr%</em> sequences and partial <a href="Concepts.htm#names">names</a> (without any spaces or other characters between them), they are combined to form a single name.</p>
      <p>An <a href="objects/Error.htm">Error</a> is typically thrown if the variable does not already exist, or if it is uninitialized and its value is being read. The <a href="#or-maybe">or-maybe operator (??)</a> can be used to avoid that case by providing a default value. For example: <code>%'novar'% ?? 42</code>.</p>
      <p>Although this is historically known as a "double-deref", this term is inaccurate when <em>Expr</em> does not contain a variable (first deref), and also when the resulting variable is the target of an assignment, not being dereferenced (second deref).</p>

  <tr id="objdot">
    <td class="center bold">x.y<br>x.%z%</td>
    <td><strong>Member access</strong>. Get or set a value or call a method of object <i>x</i>, where <i>y</i> is a literal name and <em>z</em> is an expression which evaluates to a name. See <a href="Objects.htm#Usage_Objects">object syntax</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="maybe">
    <td class="center"><em>var</em><strong>?</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Maybe</strong>. Permits the variable to be unset. This is valid only when passing a variable to an optional parameter, array element or object literal; or on the right-hand side of a direct assignment. The question mark must be followed by one of the following symbols (ignoring whitespace): <code class="no-highlight">)]},:</code>. The variable may be passed conditionally via the <a href="#ternary">ternary operator</a> or on the right-hand side of <a href="#and">AND</a>/<a href="#or">OR</a>.</p>
      <p>The variable is typically an optional parameter, but can be any variable. For variables that are not function parameters, a <a href="commands/_Warn.htm#VarUnset">VarUnset warning</a> may still be shown at load-time if there are other references to the variable but no assignments.</p>
      <p>This operator is currently supported only for variables. To explicitly or conditionally omit a parameter in more general cases, use the <code>unset</code> keyword.</p>
      <p>See also: <a href="Language.htm#unset">unset (Optional Parameters)</a></p>

  <tr id="IncDec">
    <td class="center bold">++<br>
    --</td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Pre- and post-increment/decrement</strong>. Adds or subtracts 1 from a variable. The operator may appear either before or after the variable's name. If it appears <em>before</em> the name, the operation is performed and its result is used by the next operation (the result is a variable reference in this case). For example, <code>Var := ++X</code> increments X and then assigns its value to <em>Var</em>. Conversely, if the operator appears <em>after</em> the variable's name, the result is the value of X prior to performing the operation. For example, <code>Var := X++</code> increments X but <em>Var</em> receives the value X had before it was incremented.</p>
      <p>These operators can also be used with a property of an object, such as <code>myArray.Length++</code> or <code>--myArray[i]</code>. In these cases, the result of the sub-expression is always a number, not a variable reference.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="pow">
    <td class="center bold">**</td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Power</strong>. Example usage: <code>base**exponent</code>. Both <em>base</em> and <em>exponent</em> may contain a decimal point. If <em>exponent</em> is negative, the result  will be formatted as a floating point number even if <em>base</em> and <em>exponent</em> are both integers. Since ** is of higher precedence than unary minus, <code>-2**2</code> is evaluated like <code>-(2**2)</code> and so yields -4. Thus, to raise a literal negative number to a power, enclose it in parentheses such as <code>(-2)**2</code>.</p>
      <p>The power operator is right-associative. For example, <code>x ** y ** z</code> is evaluated as <code>x ** (y ** z)</code>.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A negative <em>base</em> combined with a fractional <em>exponent</em> such as <code>(-2)**0.5</code> is not supported; attempting it will cause an exception to be thrown. But both <code>(-2)**2</code> and <code>(-2)**2.0</code> are supported. If both <em>base</em> and <em>exponent</em> are 0, the result is undefined and an exception is thrown.</p>

    <td>
      <p><strong>Unary minus (-)</strong>: Inverts the sign of its operand.</p>
      <p><strong>Unary plus (+)</strong>: <code>+N</code> is equivalent to <code>-(-N)</code>. This has no effect when applied to a pure number, but can be used to convert numeric strings to pure numbers.</p>
      <p><strong>Logical-not (!)</strong>: If the operand is blank or 0, the result of applying logical-not is 1, which means "true". Otherwise, the result is 0 (false). For example: <code>!x or !(y and z)</code>. Note: The word NOT is synonymous with <strong>!</strong> except that <strong>!</strong> has a higher precedence. Consecutive unary operators such as <code><strong>!!</strong>Var</code> are allowed because they are evaluated in right-to-left order.</p>
      <p><strong>Bitwise-not (~)</strong>: This inverts each bit of its operand. As 64-bit signed integers are used, a positive input value will always give a negative result and vice versa. For example, <code>~0xf0f</code> evaluates to -0xf10 (-3856), which is binary equivalent to 0xfffffffffffff0f0. If an unsigned 32-bit value is intended, the result can be truncated with <code><i>result</i> &amp; 0xffffffff</code>. If the operand is a floating point value, a <a href="objects/Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> is thrown.</p>
      <p id="ref"><strong>Reference (&amp;)</strong>: Creates a VarRef, which is a value representing a reference to a variable. A VarRef can then be used to indirectly access the target variable. For example, <code>ref := &amp;target</code> followed by <code>%ref% := 1</code> would assign the value 1 to <em>target</em>. The VarRef would typically be passed to a function, but could be stored in an array or property. See also: <a href="#deref">Dereference</a>, <a href="Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef</a>.</p>
      <p>Taking a reference to a built-in variable such as <a href="misc/A_Clipboard.htm">A_Clipboard</a> is currently not supported, except when being passed directly to an <em>OutputVar</em> parameter of a built-in function.</p>

    </td>
    <td><p><strong>Multiply (*)</strong>: The result is an integer if both inputs are integers; otherwise, it is a floating point number.</p>
      <p><strong>Other uses</strong>: The asterisk (*) symbol is also used in <a href="Functions.htm#VariadicCall">variadic function calls</a>.</p>
      <p id="divide"><strong>True divide (/)</strong>: True division yields a floating point result even when both inputs are integers. For example, <code>3/2</code> yields 1.5 rather than 1, and <code>4/2</code> yields 2.0 rather than 2.</p>
      <p id="IntegerDivide"><strong>Integer divide (//)</strong>: The double-slash operator uses high-performance integer division. For example, <code>5//3</code> is 1 and <code>5//-3</code> is -1. If either of the inputs is in floating point format, a <a href="objects/Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> is thrown. For modulo, see <a href="commands/Math.htm#Mod">Mod</a>.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#AssignOp">*= and /= operators</a> are a shorthand way to multiply or divide the value in a variable by another value. For example, <code>Var*=2</code> produces the same result as <code>Var:=Var*2</code> (though the former performs better).</p>
    <p>Division by zero causes a <a href="objects/Error.htm#ZeroDivisionError">ZeroDivisionError</a> to be thrown.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr id="AddSub">
    <td class="center bold">+<br>
    -</td>
    <td><p><strong>Add (+)</strong> and <strong>subtract (-)</strong>. On a related note, the <a href="#AssignOp">+= and -= operators</a> are a shorthand way to increment or decrement a variable. For example, <code>Var+=2</code> produces the same result as <code>Var:=Var+2</code> (though the former performs better). Similarly, a variable can be increased or decreased by 1 by using <a href="#IncDec">Var++, Var--, ++Var, or --Var</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Other uses</strong>: If the + or - symbol is not preceded by a value (or a sub-expression which yields a value), it is interpreted as a <a href="#unary">unary operator</a> instead.</p>

      <p><strong>Bit shift left (&lt;&lt;)</strong>. Example usage: <code>Value1 &lt;&lt; Value2</code>. This is equivalent to multiplying <em>Value1</em> by "2 to the <em>Value2</em>th power".</p>
      <p><strong>Arithmetic bit shift right (&gt;&gt;)</strong>. Example usage: <code>Value1 &gt;&gt; Value2</code>. This is equivalent to dividing <em>Value1</em> by "2 to the <em>Value2</em>th power" and rounding the result to the nearest integer leftward on the number line; for example, <code>-3&gt;&gt;1</code> is -2.</p>
      <p><strong>Logical bit shift right (&gt;&gt;&gt;)</strong>. Example usage: <code>Value1 &gt;&gt;&gt; Value2</code>. Unlike arithmetic bit shift right, this does not preserve the sign of the number. For example, -1 has the same bit representation as the unsigned 64-bit integer 0xffffffffffffffff, therefore <code>-1 &gt;&gt;&gt; 1</code> is 0x7fffffffffffffff.</p>
      <p>The following applies to all three operators:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If either of the inputs is a floating-point number, a <a href="objects/Error.htm#TypeError">TypeError</a> is thrown.</li>

    <td>
      <p><strong>Concatenate</strong>. A period (dot) with at least one space or tab on each side is used to combine two items into a single string. You may also omit the period to achieve the same result (except where ambiguous such as <code>x <strong>-</strong>y</code>, or when the item on the right side has a leading ++ or --). When the dot is omitted, there must be at least one space or tab between the items to be merged.</p>
      <pre>Var := "The color is " <strong>.</strong> FoundColor  <em>; Explicit concat</em>
Var := "The color is " FoundColor    <em>; Auto-concat</em>
</pre>
      <p>Sub-expressions can also be concatenated. For example: <code>Var := "The net price is " <strong>.</strong>  Price * (1 - Discount/100)</code>.</p>
      <p>A line that begins with a period (or any other operator) is automatically <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">appended to</a> the line above it.</p>
      <p>The entire <a href="commands/StrLen.htm">length</a> of each input is used, even if it includes binary zero. For example, <code>Chr(0x2010) Chr(0x0000) Chr(0x4030)</code> produces the following string of bytes (due to UTF-16-LE encoding): 0x10, 0x20, 0, 0, 0x30, 0x40. The result has an additional null-terminator (binary zero) which is not included in the length.</p>
      <p><strong>Other uses</strong>: If there is no space or tab to the right of a period (dot), it is interpreted as either a literal <a href="#numbers">floating-point number</a> or <a href="#objdot">member access</a>. For example, <code>1.1</code> and <code>(.5)</code> are numbers, <code>A_Args.Has(3)</code> is a method call and <code>A_Args.Length</code> is a property access.</p>

The <strong>==</strong> operator behaves identically to <strong>=</strong> except when either of the inputs is not numeric (or both are strings), in which case <strong>==</strong> is always case sensitive and <strong>=</strong> is always case insensitive. The <strong>!=</strong> and <strong>!==</strong> behave identically to their counterparts without <strong>!</strong>, except that the result is inverted.</p>
      <p>The <strong>==</strong> and <strong>!==</strong> operators can be used to compare strings which contain binary zero. All other comparison operators except <strong>~=</strong> compare only up to the first binary zero.</p>
      <p>For case insensitive comparisons, only the ASCII letters A-Z are considered equivalent to their lowercase counterparts.

      <p><strong>Or maybe</strong>, otherwise known as the coalescing operator. If the left operand (which must be a variable) has a value, it becomes the result and the right branch is skipped. Otherwise, the right operand becomes the result. In other words, <code>A ?? B</code> behaves like <code>A || B</code> (<a href="#or">logical-OR</a>) except that the condition is <code>IsSet(A)</code>.</p>

      <p><strong>Ternary operator</strong>. This operator is a shorthand replacement for the <a href="commands/If.htm">if-else statement</a>. It evaluates the condition on its left side to determine which of its two branches should become its final result. For example, <code>var := x&gt;y ? 2 : 3</code> stores 2 in <em>Var</em> if x is greater than y; otherwise it stores 3. To enhance performance, only the winning branch is evaluated (see <a href="Functions.htm#ShortCircuit">short-circuit evaluation</a>).</p>

    <td><p><strong>Assign</strong>. Performs an operation on the contents of a variable and stores the result back in the same variable. The simplest assignment operator is colon-equals (:=), which stores the result of an expression in a variable. For a description of what the other operators do, see their related entries in this table. For example, <code>Var //= 2</code> performs <a href="#IntegerDivide">integer division</a> to divide <em>Var</em> by 2, then stores the result back in <em>Var</em>. Similarly, <code>Var <strong>.=</strong> "abc"</code> is a shorthand way of writing <code>Var := Var <strong>.</strong> "abc"</code>.</p>
      <p>Unlike most other operators, assignments are evaluated from right to left. Consequently, a line such as <code>Var1 := Var2 := 0</code> first assigns 0 to <em>Var2</em> then assigns <em>Var2</em> to <em>Var1</em>.</p>
    <p>If an assignment is used as the input for some other operator, its value is the variable itself. For example,  the expression <code>(Var+=2) &gt; 50</code> is true if the newly-increased value in <em>Var</em> is greater than 50. It is also valid to combine an assignment with the <a href="#ref">reference operator</a>, as in <code>&amp;(Var := "initial value")</code>.</p>
    <p>The precedence of the assignment operators is automatically raised when it would avoid a syntax error or provide more intuitive behavior. For example: <code>not x:=y</code> is evaluated as <code>not (x:=y)</code>. Similarly, <code>++Var := X</code> is evaluated as <code>++(Var := X)</code>; and <code>Z&gt;0 ? X:=2 : Y:=2</code> is evaluated as <code>Z&gt;0 ? (X:=2) : (Y:=2)</code>.</p>
    <p>The target variable can be <em>un-set</em> by combining a direct assignment (<code>:=</code>) with the <code>unset</code> keyword or the <a href="#maybe">maybe (<em>var</em>?)</a> operator. For example: <code>Var := unset</code>, <code>Var1 := (Var2?)</code>.</p>
    <p>An assignment can also target a property of an object, such as <code>myArray.Length += n</code> or <code>myArray[i] .= t</code>. When assigning to a property, the result of the sub-expression is the value being assigned, not a variable reference.</p>

      <p><strong>Fat arrow function</strong>. Defines a simple <a href="Functions.htm">function</a> and returns a <a href="objects/Func.htm">Func</a> or <a href="Functions.htm#closures">Closure</a> object. Write the function's <a href="Functions.htm#param">parameter list</a> (optionally preceded by a function name) to the left of the operator. When the function is called (via the returned reference), it evaluates the sub-expression <em>expr</em> and returns the result.</p>
      <p>The following two examples are equivalent:</p>
      <pre>sumfn := Sum(a, b) =&gt; a + b</pre>
      <pre>Sum(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
sumfn := Sum</pre>
      <p>In both cases, the function is defined <strong>unconditionally</strong> at the moment the script launches, but the function reference is stored in <em>sumfn</em> only if and when the assignment is evaluated.</p>
      <p>If the function name is omitted and the parameter list consists of only a single parameter name, the parentheses can be omitted. The example below defines an anonymous function with one parameter <code>a</code> and stores its reference in the variable <code>double</code>:</p>
      <pre>double := a =&gt; a * 2</pre>
      <p>Variable references in <em>expr</em> are resolved in the same way as in the equivalent full function definition. For instance, <em>expr</em> may refer to an outer function's local variables (as in any <a href="Functions.htm#nested">nested function</a>), in which case a new <a href="Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> is created and returned each time the fat arrow expression is evaluated. The function is always <a href="Functions.htm#AssumeLocal">assume-local</a>, since declarations cannot be used.</p>
      <p>Specifying a name for the function allows it to be called recursively or by other nested functions without storing a reference to the <a href="Functions.htm#closures">closure</a> within itself (thereby creating a problematic <a href="Objects.htm#Circular_References">circular reference</a>). It can also be helpful for debugging, such with <a href="objects/Func.htm#Name">Func.Name</a> or when displayed on the debugger's call stack.</p>
      <p>Fat arrow syntax can also be used to define shorthand <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_property_short">properties</a> and <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_method">methods</a>.</p>

<p id="CommaPerf"><strong>Performance</strong>: The comma operator is usually faster than writing separate expressions, especially when assigning one variable to another (e.g. <code>x:=y, a:=b</code>).

      <p>Note: Unlike variables such as A_ThisHotkey, each <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> retains its own value for A_EventInfo. Therefore, if a thread is interrupted by another, upon being resumed it will still see its original/correct values in these variables.</p>
      <p>A_EventInfo can also be set by the script, but can only accept unsigned integers within the range available to pointers (32-bit or 64-bit depending on the version of AutoHotkey).</p></td>

  <tr id="LastError">
    <td>A_LastError</td>
    <td><p>This is usually the result from the OS's GetLastError() function after the script calls certain functions, including <a href="commands/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a>, <a href="commands/Run.htm">Run/RunWait</a>, File/Ini/Reg functions (where documented) and possibly others. A_LastError is a number between 0 and 4294967295 (always formatted as decimal, not hexadecimal). Zero (0) means success, but any other number means the call failed. Each number corresponds to a specific error condition (to get a list, search <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a> for "system error codes"). A_LastError is a per-thread setting; that is, interruptions by other <a href="misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> cannot change it.</p>
    <p>Assigning a value to A_LastError also causes the OS's SetLastError() function to be called.</p></td>

<h2 id="cap">Variable Capacity and Memory</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When a variable is given a new string longer than its current contents, additional system memory is allocated automatically.</li>
  <li>The memory occupied by a large variable can be freed by setting it equal to nothing, e.g. <code>var := ""</code>.</li>
  <li>There is no limit to how many variables a script may create. The program is designed to support at least several million variables without a significant drop in performance.</li>
  <li>Functions and expressions that accept numeric inputs generally support 15 digits of precision for floating point values. For integers, 64-bit signed values are supported, which range from -9223372036854775808 (-0x8000000000000000) to 9223372036854775807 (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). Any integer constants outside this range wrap around. Similarly, arithmetic operations on integers wrap around upon overflow (e.g. 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF + 1 = -0x8000000000000000).</li>
