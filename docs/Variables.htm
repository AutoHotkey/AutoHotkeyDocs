<span id="Variables"></span><h2 id="Intro">Variables</h2>
<p id="Variable_types"><strong>Variable types</strong>: AutoHotkey has no explicitly defined variable types. Instead, any variable can contain a string, integer, floating-point number, or reference to an object. Additionally, numbers are automatically converted to or from strings as required. The <a href="commands/Type.htm">Type</a> function can be used to determine the actual type of a value.</p>
<p id="Variable_scope"><strong>Variable scope and declarations</strong>: With the exception of <a href="Functions.htm#Locals">local variables</a> in functions, all variables are global; that is, their contents may be read or altered by any part of the script. Except where noted on the <a href="Functions.htm#Global">functions page</a>, variables do not need to be declared; they come into existence simply by using them (and each variable starts off empty/blank).</p>
<p id="Variable_names"><strong>Variable names</strong>: Variable names are not case sensitive (for example, <em>CurrentDate</em> is the same as <em>currentdate</em>). Variable names may be up to 253 characters long and may consist of letters, numbers, underscore and non-ASCII characters. Variable names must not start with a digit.</p>
<p id="Reserved_words"><strong>Reserved words:</strong> <code>and</code>, <code>contains</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>new</code>, <code>not</code> and <code>or</code>. These words are reserved for use as <a href="#Operators">operators</a> and therefore cannot be used as variable names when written literally in an expression.</p>
<p>Names of control flow statements are also reserved, primarily to detect mistakes. This includes: <code>Break</code>, <code>Catch</code>, <code>Continue</code>, <code>Else</code>, <code>Finally</code>, <code>For</code>, <code>Gosub</code>, <code>Goto</code>, <code>If</code>, <code>Loop</code>, <code>LoopFile</code>, <code>LoopParse</code>, <code>LoopRead</code>, <code>LoopReg</code>, <code>Return</code>, <code>Throw</code>, <code>Try</code>, <code>Until</code>, <code>While</code></p>
<p>Functions, classes and window groups use the same validation as variables and therefore have the same restrictions.</p>
<p id="assigning"><strong>Storing values in variables</strong>: To store a string or number in a variable, use the <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">colon-equal operator (:=)</a> followed by a number, quoted string or any other type of <a href="#Expressions">expression</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>MyNumber := 123
MyString := &quot;This is a literal string.&quot;
CopyOfVar := Var</pre>
<p>Variables which have not been assigned a value contain an empty string by default. Therefore, to erase the contents of a variable, simply assign an empty string:</p>
<pre>MyVar := &quot;&quot;</pre>
<p>A variable can also be assigned a value indirectly, by using it as an <em>output variable</em> of a command. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/MouseGetPos.htm">MouseGetPos</a> <strong>x</strong>, <strong>y</strong></pre>
<p id="retrieving"><strong>Retrieving the contents of variables</strong>: To include the contents of a variable in a string, use <a href="#concat">concatenation</a> or <a href="commands/Format.htm">Format</a>. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> "The value of Var is " . Var . "."
MsgBox "The value in the variable named Var is " Var "."
MsgBox Format("Var has the value {1}.", Var)
</pre>
<p>Sub-expressions can be combined with strings in the same way. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox(&quot;The sum of X and Y is &quot; . (X + Y))
</pre>
<p><strong>Comparing variables</strong>: Please read the expressions section below for important notes about the different kinds of comparisons.</p>
<h2 id="Expressions">Expressions</h2>
<p>Expressions are used to perform one or more operations upon a series of variables, literal strings, and/or literal numbers.</p>
<p>Variable names in an expression are not enclosed in percent signs (except for variables inside quoted strings, and <a href="misc/Arrays.htm#pseudo">pseudo-arrays</a> and other <a href="#ref">double references</a>). Consequently, literal strings must be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them from variables. For example:</p>
<pre>if (CurrentSetting &gt; 100 or FoundColor &lt;&gt; &quot;Blue&quot;)
    MsgBox "The setting is too high or the wrong color is present."</pre>
<p>In the example above, &quot;Blue&quot; appears in quotes because it is a literal string. Single-quote marks (&apos;) and double-quote marks (&quot;) function identically, except that a string enclosed in single-quote marks can contain literal double-quote marks and vice versa. Therefore, to include an <em>actual</em> quote mark inside a literal string, <a href="misc/EscapeChar.htm">escape</a> the quote mark or enclose the string in the opposite type of quote mark. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox &quot;She said, <span class="red">`&quot;</span>An apple a day.<span class="red">`&quot;</span>&quot;
MsgBox <span class="red">&apos;</span>She said, &quot;An apple a day.&quot;<span class="red">&apos;</span></pre>
<p><strong>Empty strings</strong>: To specify an empty string in an expression, use an empty pair of quotes. For example, the statement <code>if (MyVar &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;)</code> would be true if <em>MyVar</em> is not blank.</p>
<p><strong>Storing the result of an expression</strong>: To assign a result to a variable, use the <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">:= operator</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>NetPrice := Price * (1 - Discount/100)</pre>
<p id="Boolean"><strong>Boolean values</strong>: When an expression is required to evaluate to true or false (such as an IF-statement), a blank or zero result is considered false and all other results are considered true. For example, the statement <code>if ItemCount</code> would be false only if ItemCount is blank or 0. Similarly, the expression <code>if not ItemCount</code> would yield the opposite result.</p>
<p>Operators such as NOT/&gt;/=/&lt; automatically produce a true or false value: they yield 1 for true and 0 for false. However, the AND/OR operators always produce one of the input values. For example, in the following expression, the variable <em>Done</em> is assigned 1 if A_Index is greater than 5 or the value of <em>FoundIt</em> in all other cases:</p>
<pre>Done := A_Index &gt; 5 or FoundIt</pre>
<p>As hinted above, a variable can be used to hold a false value simply by making it blank or assigning 0 to it. To take advantage of this, the shorthand statement <code>if Done</code> can be used to check whether the variable Done is true or false.</p>
<p><span id="True"></span><span id="False"></span>In an expression, the keywords <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> resolve to 1 and 0. They can be used to make a script more readable as in these examples:</p>
<pre>CaseSensitive := false
ContinueSearch := true</pre>
<p><strong>Integers and floating point</strong>: Within an expression, numbers are considered to be floating point if they contain a decimal point or scientific notation; otherwise, they are integers. For most operators -- such as addition and multiplication -- if either of the inputs is a floating point number, the result will also be a floating point number.</p>
<p>Within expressions and non-expressions alike, integers may be written in either hexadecimal or decimal format. Hexadecimal numbers all start with the prefix 0x. For example, <code>Sleep 0xFF</code> is equivalent to <code>Sleep 255</code>. Floating point numbers can optionally be written in scientific notation, with or without a decimal point (e.g. <code>1e4</code> or <code>-2.1E-4</code>).</p>
<p>Within expressions, unquoted literal numbers such as <code>128</code>, <code>0x7F</code> and <code>1.0</code> are converted to pure numbers before the script begins executing, so converting the number to a string may produce a value different to the original literal value. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox(0x7F)  <em>; Shows 128</em>
MsgBox(1.00)  <em>; Shows 1.0</em></pre>

<h2 id="Operators">Operators in Expressions</h2>
<p>Operators of equal precedence such as multiply (*) and divide (/) are evaluated in left-to-right order unless otherwise specified below. By contrast, an operator of lower precedence such as add (+) is evaluated <em>after</em> a higher one such as multiply (*). For example, 3 + 2 * 2 is evaluated as 3 + (2 * 2). Parentheses may be used to override precedence as in this example: (3 + 2) * 2</p>
<p>Except where noted below, any blank value (empty string) or non-numeric value involved in a math operation is <strong>not</strong> assumed to be zero. Instead, it is treated as an error, which causes that part of the expression to evaluate to an empty string. For example, if the variable X is blank, the expression X+1 yields a blank value rather than 1.</p>

<h3>Expression Operators (in descending precedence order)</h3>
<table class="info">
  <tr id="ref">
    <td style="text-align:center; white-space:nowrap"><strong>%Expr%</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p>Evaluates the sub-expression <em>Expr</em> and uses its value as the name or partial name of a variable or function. This allows the script to refer to a variable or function whose name is not written literally in the script, but is determined by evaluating <em>Expr</em>, which is typically another variable. Percent signs cannot be used directly within <em>Expr</em> due to ambiguity, but can be nested within parentheses. Otherwise, <em>Expr</em> can be any expression.</p>
      <p><code>%Expr%()</code> performs a <a href="Functions.htm#DynCall">dynamic function call</a>.</p>
      <p><code>%Expr%</code> dynamically retrieves a variable by name. The <u>result</u> of the sub-expression <em>Expr</em> must be the name or partial name of the variable to be retrieved. If there are any adjoining <em>%Expr%</em> sequences and partial <a href="#Variable_names">variable names</a> (without any spaces or other characters between them), they are combined to form a single name.</p>
      <p>If the variable does not already exist, a blank variable is created. An <a href="commands/Throw.htm#Exception">exception</a> is thrown if the name is <a href="#Variable_names">invalid</a>.</p>
      <p>This is most commonly used to reference <a href="misc/Arrays.htm#pseudo">pseudo-array</a> elements such as in the following example:</p>
      <pre>Loop 4
    MsgBox("IP address " A_Index " is " <a href="#IPAddress">A_IPAddress</a>%<a href="commands/Loop.htm">A_Index</a>%)</pre>
      <p>Although this is historically known as a "double-deref", this term is inaccurate when <em>Expr</em> does not contain a variable (first deref), and also when the resulting variable is the target of an assignment, not being dereferenced (second deref).</p>

    <td><strong>Object access</strong>. Get or set a value or call a method of object <i>x</i>, where <i>y</i> is a literal value. See <a href="Objects.htm#Usage_Objects">object syntax</a>.</td>

  <tr id="new">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>new</strong></td>
    <td><code>new <i>Class</i></code> or <code>new <i>Class</i>(<i>Params</i>)</code> creates a new object derived from <em>Class</em>. For example, <code>x := new y</code> is often equivalent to <code>x := {base: y}</code>. <em>Class</em> can be almost any expression which produces a class object, but is typically a class name such as <code>GlobalClass</code> or <code>GlobalClass.NestedClass</code>. More complex cases such as <code>new new (getClass())(params1)(params2)</code> are also supported, but there must be no space between the class expression and parameter list. For details, see <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Objects">Custom Objects</a>.</td>

  <tr id="IncDec">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>++<br>
    --</strong></td>
    <td>
      <p><strong>Pre- and post-increment/decrement</strong>. Adds or subtracts 1 from a variable. The operator may appear either before or after the variable's name. If it appears <em>before</em> the name, the operation is performed immediately and its result is used by the next operation. For example, <code>Var := ++X</code> increments X immediately and then assigns its value to <em>Var</em>. Conversely, if the operator appears <em>after</em> the variable's name, the operation is performed <em>after</em> the variable is used by the next operation. For example, <code>Var := X++</code> increments X only after assigning the current value of X to <em>Var</em>. Due to backward compatibility, the operators ++ and -- treat blank variables as zero, but only when they are alone on a line; for example, <code>y:=1, ++x</code> and <code>MsgBox ++x</code> both produce a blank result when x is blank.</p>
      <p>If the target variable is empty, the operators <strong>++</strong> and <strong>--</strong> treat it as zero. This allows a line such as <code>Var++</code> to be used in a hotkey without <em>Var</em> having been initialized in the <a href="Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>.</p>

  <tr id="pow">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>**</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Power</strong>. Both the base and the exponent may contain a decimal point. If the exponent is negative, the result  will be formatted as a floating point number even if the base and exponent are both integers. Since ** is of higher precedence than unary minus, <code>-2**2</code> is evaluated like <code>-(2**2)</code> and so yields -4. Thus, to raise a literal negative number to a power, enclose it in parentheses such as <code>(-2)**2</code>. Note: A negative base combined with a fractional exponent such as <code>(-2)**0.5</code> is not supported; it will yield an empty string. But both <code>(-2)**2</code> and <code>(-2)**2.0</code> are supported.</td>

    <td>
      <p><strong>Unary minus (-)</strong>: Inverts the sign of its operand.</p>
      <p><strong>Unary plus (+)</strong>: <code>+N</code> is equivalent to <code>-(-N)</code>. This has no effect when applied to a pure number, but can be used to convert numeric strings to pure numbers. As with other math operators, the result is a blank value (empty string) if the operand is not a number or numeric string.</p>
      <p><strong>Logical-not (!)</strong>: If the operand is blank or 0, the result of applying logical-not is 1, which means &quot;true&quot;. Otherwise, the result is 0 (false). For example: <code>!x or !(y and z)</code>. Note: The word NOT is synonymous with <strong>!</strong> except that <strong>!</strong> has a higher precedence. Consecutive unary operators such as <code><strong>!!</strong>Var</code> are allowed because they are evaluated in right-to-left order.</p>
      <p><strong>Bitwise-not (~)</strong>: This inverts each bit of its operand. If the operand is a floating point value, it is truncated to an integer prior to the calculation. If the operand  is between 0 and 4294967295 (0xffffffff), it will be treated as an <u>unsigned</u> 32-bit value. Otherwise, it is treated as a <u>signed</u> 64-bit value. For example, <code>~0xf0f</code> evaluates to 0xfffff0f0 (4294963440).</p>
      <p id="amp"><strong>Address (&amp;)</strong>: <code>&amp;MyVar</code> retrieves the address of <em>MyVar</em>'s contents in memory, which is typically used with <a href="commands/DllCall.htm#struct">DllCall structures</a>. <em>MyVar</em>'s contents can be a string, a 64-bit integer, a 64-bit floating-point number, or an object.</p>

    <td><p><strong>Multiply (*)</strong>: The result is an integer if both inputs are integers; otherwise, it is a floating point number.</p>
      <p id="divide"><strong>True divide (/)</strong>: True division yields a floating point result even when both inputs are integers. For example, <code>3/2</code> yields 1.5 rather than 1, and <code>4/2</code> yields 2.0 rather than 2.</p>
      <p id="FloorDivide"><strong>Floor divide (//)</strong>: The double-slash operator uses high-performance integer division if the two inputs are integers. For example, <code>5//3</code> is 1 and <code>5//-3</code> is -1. If either of the inputs is in floating point format, floating point division is performed and the result is truncated to the nearest integer to the left. For example, <code>5//3.0</code> is 1.0 and <code>5.0//-3</code> is -2.0. Although the result of this floating point division is an integer, it is stored in floating point format so that anything else that uses it will see it as such. For modulo, see <a href="commands/Math.htm#Mod">mod()</a>.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#AssignOp">*=</a> and <a href="#AssignOp">/=</a> operators are a shorthand way to multiply or divide the value in a variable by another value. For example, <code>Var*=2</code> produces the same result as <code>Var:=Var*2</code> (though the former performs better).</p>

On a related note, the <a href="#AssignOp"><strong>+=</strong></a> and <a href="#AssignOp"><strong>-=</strong></a> operators are a shorthand way to increment or decrement a variable. For example, <code>Var+=2</code> produces the same result as <code>Var:=Var+2</code> (though the former performs better).

Any floating point input is truncated to an integer prior to the calculation. Shift left (<strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>) is equivalent to multiplying <em>Value1</em> by &quot;2 to the <em>Value2</em>th power&quot;. Shift right (<strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>) is equivalent to dividing <em>Value1</em> by &quot;2 to the <em>Value2</em>th power&quot; and rounding the result to the nearest integer leftward on the number line; for example, <code>-3&gt;&gt;1</code> is -2.</td>

      <p><strong>Concatenate</strong>. The period (dot) operator is used to combine two items into a single string (there must be at least one space on each side of the period). You may also omit the period to achieve the same result (except where ambiguous such as <code>x <strong>-</strong>y</code>, or when the item on the right side has a leading ++ or --). When the dot is omitted, there must be at least one space between the items to be merged.</p>

    <td><p><strong>Assign</strong>. Performs an operation on the contents of a variable and stores the result back in the same variable. The simplest assignment operator is <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">colon-equals (:=)</a>, which stores the result of an expression in a variable. For a description of what the other operators do, see their related entries in this table. For example, <code>Var //= 2</code> performs <a href="#FloorDivide">floor division</a> to divide <em>Var</em> by 2, then stores the result back in <em>Var</em>. Similarly, <code>Var <strong>.=</strong> &quot;abc&quot;</code> is a shorthand way of writing <code>Var := Var <strong>.</strong> &quot;abc&quot;</code>.</p>
      <p>Unlike most other operators, assignments are evaluated from right to left. Consequently, a line such as <code>Var1 := Var2 := 0</code> first assigns 0 to <em>Var2</em> then assigns <em>Var2</em> to <em>Var1</em>.</p>
    <p>If an assignment is used as the input for some other operator, its value is the variable itself. For example,  the expression <code>(Var+=2) &gt; 50</code> is true if the newly-increased value in <em>Var</em> is greater than 50. This also allows an assignment to be passed <a href="Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef</a>, or its <a href="#amp">address</a> taken; for example: <code>&amp;(x:=&quot;abc&quot;)</code>.</p>
    <p>The precedence of the assignment operators is automatically raised when it would avoid a syntax error or provide more intuitive behavior. For example: <code>not x:=y</code> is evaluated as <code>not (x:=y)</code>. Similarly, <code>++Var := X</code> is evaluated as <code>++(Var := X)</code>; and <code>Z&gt;0 ? X:=2 : Y:=2</code> is evaluated as <code>Z&gt;0 ? (X:=2) : (Y:=2)</code>.</p>
    <p>If the target variable is empty, the operators <strong>+=</strong> and <strong>-=</strong> treat it as zero. This allows a line such as <code>Var += 1</code> to be used in a hotkey without <em>Var</em> having been initialized in the <a href="Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>.</p>

  <tr id="comma">
    <td style="text-align:center"><strong>,</strong></td>
    <td><p><strong>Comma (multi-statement)</strong>. Commas may be used to write multiple sub-expressions on a single line. This is most commonly used to group together multiple assignments or function calls.  For example: <code>x:=1<strong>,</strong> y+=2<strong>,</strong> ++index, func()</code>. Such statements are executed in order from left to right. Note: A line that begins with a comma (or any other operator) is automatically <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">appended to</a> the line above it. See also: <a href="#CommaPerf">comma performance</a>.</p>
        <p>When a multi-statement expression is used inside another expression, each sub-expression is evaluated and the value of the final (rightmost) sub-expression becomes the result of the expression. For example, <code>x := (++y, 1)</code> increments y and assigns the number 1 to x.</p>

<p id="CommaPerf"><strong>Performance</strong>: The comma operator is usually faster than writing separate expressions, especially when assigning one variable to another (e.g. <code>x:=y, a:=b</code>). Performance continues to improve as more and more expressions are combined into a single expression; for example, it may be 35% faster to combine five or ten simple expressions into a single expression.</p>

<h2 id="env">Environment Variables vs. &quot;Normal&quot; Variables</h2>
<p>Environment variables are maintained by the operating system. You can see a list of them at the command prompt by typing SET then pressing Enter. Use <a href="commands/EnvGet.htm">EnvGet</a> or <a href="commands/EnvSet.htm">EnvSet</a> to retrieve or set environment variable.</p>
<p>A script may create a new environment variable or change the contents of an existing one with <a href="commands/EnvSet.htm">EnvSet</a>. However, such additions and changes are private; they are not seen by the rest of the system. One exception is when a script uses <a href="commands/Run.htm">Run</a> or <a href="commands/Run.htm">RunWait</a> to launch a program (even another script): such programs inherit a copy of the parent script's environment variables, including private ones.</p>

<h2 id="cap">Variable Capacity and Memory</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When a variable is given a new string longer than its current contents, additional system memory is allocated automatically.</li>
  <li>The memory occupied by a large variable can be freed by setting it equal to nothing, e.g. <code>var := &quot;&quot;</code>.</li>
  <li>There is no limit to how many variables a script may create. The program is designed to support at least several million variables without a significant drop in performance.</li>
  <li>Commands, functions, and expressions that accept numeric inputs generally support 15 digits of precision for floating point values. For integers, 64-bit signed values are supported, which range from -9223372036854775808 (-0x8000000000000000) to 9223372036854775807 (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). Any integer constants outside this range are not supported and might yield inconsistent results. By contrast, arithmetic operations on integers wrap around upon overflow (e.g. 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF + 1 = -0x8000000000000000).</li>
</ul>
