<h2 id="Intro"><a name="Variables"></a>Variables</h2>
<p><strong>Variable types</strong>: AutoHotkey has no explicitly defined variable types. However, a variable containing only digits (with an optional decimal point) is automatically interpreted as a number when a math operation or comparison requires it. (To improve performance, numbers are cached internally to avoid conversions to/from strings.)</p>
<p><strong>Variable scope and declarations</strong>: With the exception of <a href="Functions.htm#Locals">local variables</a> in functions, all variables are global; that is, their contents may be read or altered by any part of the script. Except where noted on the <a href="Functions.htm#Global">functions page</a>, variables are not declared; they come into existence simply by using them (and each variable starts off empty/blank).</p>
<p><strong>Variable names</strong>: Variable names are not case sensitive (for example, <em>CurrentDate</em> is the same as <em>currentdate</em>). Variable names may be up to 253 characters long and may consist of letters, numbers and the following punctuation: # _ @ $</p>
<p>Due to style conventions, it is generally better to name your variables using only letters, numbers, and the underscore character (for example: <em>CursorPosition</em>, <em>Total_Items</em>, and <em>entry_is_valid</em>). This style allows people familiar with other computer languages to understand your scripts more easily. Also, if you use&nbsp;the same conventions in AutoHotkey as you use&nbsp;in other languages, you may find it easier to re-read your own scripts.</p>
<p>Although a variable name may consist entirely of digits, this is generally used only for <a href="Scripts.htm#cmd">incoming command line parameters</a>. Such numeric names cannot be used in <a href="#Expressions">expressions</a> because they would be seen as numbers rather than variables.</p>
<p>Since the words <em>AND</em>, <em>OR</em>, and <em>NOT</em> are used as <a href="#Operators">operators</a> in expressions, generally they should not be used as variable names. Using such names in an expression would prevent proper evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Storing values in variables</strong>: To store a string or number in a variable, there are two methods: traditional and expression. The traditional method uses the <a href="commands/SetEnv.htm">equal sign operator (=)</a> to assign <strong>unquoted</strong> literal strings or variables enclosed in percent signs. For example:</p>
<pre>MyNumber = 123
MyString = This is a literal string.
CopyOfVar = %Var%  <em>; With the = operator, percent signs are required to retrieve a variable's contents.</em></pre>
<p> By contrast, the expression method uses the <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">colon-equal operator (:=)</a> to store numbers, <strong>quoted</strong> strings, and other types of <a href="#Expressions">expressions</a>. The following examples are functionally identical to the previous ones:</p>
<pre>MyNumber := 123
MyString := &quot;This is a literal string.&quot;
CopyOfVar := Var  <em>; Unlike its counterpart in the previous section, percent signs are not used with the := operator.</em></pre>
<p>The latter method is preferred by many due to its greater clarity, and because it supports an <a href="#Expressions">expression syntax</a> nearly identical to that in many other languages.</p>
<p>You may have guessed from the above that there are two methods to erase the contents of a variable (that is, to make it blank):</p>
<pre>MyVar =
MyVar := &quot;&quot;</pre>
<p>The empty pair of quotes above should be used only with the := operator because if it were used with the = operator, it would store two literal quote-characters inside the variable.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieving the contents of variables</strong>: Like the two methods of storing values, there are also two methods for retrieving them: traditional and expression. The traditional method requires that each variable name be enclosed in percent signs to retrieve its contents. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> The value in the variable named Var is %Var%.
CopyOfVar = %Var%</pre>
<p>By contrast, the expression method omits the percent signs around variable names, but encloses literal strings in quotes. Thus, the following are the expression equivalents of the previous examples:</p>
<pre>MsgBox <strong>%</strong> &quot;The value in the variable named Var is &quot; . Var . &quot;.&quot;  <em>; A period is used to concatenate (join) two strings.</em>
CopyOfVar := Var</pre>
<p>In the MsgBox line above, a percent sign and a space is used to change the parameter from traditional to expression mode. This is necessary because the traditional method is used by default by all commands (except where otherwise documented). However, certain parameters of some commands are documented as accepting expressions, in which case the leading percent sign is permitted but not necessary. For example, all of the following are effectively identical because <a href="commands/Sleep.htm">Sleep</a>'s first parameter is expression-capable:</p>
<pre>Sleep MillisecondsToWait
Sleep %MillisecondsToWait%
Sleep % MillisecondsToWait</pre>
<p><strong>Comparing variables</strong>: Please read the expressions section below for important notes about the different kinds of comparisons, especially  about when to use parentheses.</p>
<h2 id="Expressions">Expressions</h2>
<p>Expressions are used to perform one or more operations upon a series of variables, literal strings, and/or literal numbers.</p>
<p>Variable names in an expression are not enclosed in percent signs (except for arrays and other <a href="#ref">double references</a>). Consequently, literal strings must be enclosed in double quotes to distinguish them from variables. For example:</p>
<pre>if (CurrentSetting &gt; 100 or FoundColor &lt;&gt; &quot;Blue&quot;)
    MsgBox The setting is too high or the wrong color is present.</pre>
<p>In the example above, &quot;Blue&quot; appears in quotes because it is a literal string. To include an <em>actual</em> quote-character inside a literal string, specify two consecutive quotes as shown twice in this example: &quot;She said, <span class="red">&quot;&quot;</span>An apple a day.<span class="red">&quot;&quot;</span>&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: An if-statement that contains an expression is differentiated from a <a href="commands/IfEqual.htm">traditional if-statement</a> such as <em>If FoundColor &lt;&gt; Blue</em> by making the character after the word &quot;if&quot; an open-parenthesis. Although this is usually accomplished by enclosing the entire expression in parentheses, it can also be done with something like <em>if (x &gt; 0) and (y &gt; 0)</em>. In addition, the open-parenthesis may be omitted entirely if the first item after the word &quot;if&quot; is a <a href="Functions.htm">function call</a> or an operator such as &quot;not&quot; or &quot;!&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Empty strings</strong>: To specify an empty string in an expression, use an empty pair of quotes. For example, the statement <em>if (MyVar &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;)</em> would be true if <em>MyVar</em> is not blank. However, in a <a href="commands/IfEqual.htm">traditional-if</a>,  a pair of empty quotes is treated literally. For example, the statement <em>if MyVar = &quot;&quot;</em> is true only if <em>MyVar</em> contains an actual pair of quotes. Thus, to check if a variable is blank with a traditional-if, use = or &lt;&gt; with nothing on the right side as in this example: <em>if Var =</em></p>
<p>On a related note, any invalid expression such as (x +* 3) yields an empty string.</p>
<p><strong>Storing the result of an expression</strong>: To assign a result to a variable, use the <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">:= operator</a>. For example:</p>
<pre>NetPrice := Price * (1 - Discount/100)</pre>
<p><strong>Boolean values</strong>: When an expression is required to evaluate to true or false (such as an IF-statement), a blank or zero result is considered false and all other results are considered true. For example, the statement &quot;if ItemCount&quot; would be false only if ItemCount is blank or 0. Similarly, the expression &quot;if not ItemCount&quot; would yield the opposite result.</p>
<p>Operators such as NOT/AND/OR/&gt;/=/&lt; automatically produce a true or false value: they yield 1 for true and 0 for false. For example, in the following expression, the variable <em>Done</em> is assigned 1 if either of the conditions is true:</p>
<pre>Done := A_Index &gt; 5 or FoundIt</pre>
<p>As hinted above, a variable can be used to hold a false value simply by making it blank or assigning 0 to it. To take advantage of this, the shorthand statement &quot;if Done&quot; can be used to check whether the variable Done is true or false.</p>
<p><a name="True"></a><a name="False"></a>The words <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> are built-in variables containing 1 and 0. They can be used to make a script more readable as in these examples:</p>
<pre>CaseSensitive := false
ContinueSearch := true</pre>
<p><strong>Integers and floating point</strong>: Within an expression, numbers are considered to be floating point if they contain a decimal point; otherwise, they are integers. For most operators -- such as addition and multiplication -- if either of the inputs is a floating point number, the result will also be a floating point number.</p>
<p>Within expressions and non-expressions alike, integers may be written in either hexadecimal or decimal format. Hexadecimal numbers all start with the prefix 0x. For example, <em>Sleep 0xFF</em> is equivalent to <em>Sleep 255</em>. In v1.0.46.11+, floating point numbers written in scientific notation are recognized; but only if they contain a decimal point (e.g. 1<strong>.</strong>0e4 and -2<strong>.</strong>1E-4).</p>
<p><strong>Force an expression</strong>: An expression can be used in a parameter that does not directly support it (except an OutputVar or InputVar parameter such as those of <a href="commands/StringLen.htm">StringLen</a>) by preceding the expression with a percent sign and a space or tab. This technique is often used to access <a href="misc/Arrays.htm">arrays</a>. For example:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>, <strong>%</strong> MyArray%i%, My File.txt
<a href="commands/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> <strong>%</strong> &quot;The variable MyVar contains &quot; . MyVar . &quot;.&quot;
<a href="commands/Loop.htm">Loop</a> <strong>%</strong> Iterations + 1
<a href="commands/WinSet.htm">WinSet</a>, Transparent, <strong>%</strong> X + 100
<a href="commands/WinSet.htm">Control</a>, Choose, <strong>%</strong> CurrentSelection - 1</pre>
<h2 id="Operators">Operators in Expressions</h2>
<p> Operators of equal precedence such as multiply (*) and divide (/) are evaluated in left-to-right order unless otherwise specified below. By contrast, an operator of lower precedence such as add (+) is evaluated <em>after</em> a higher one such as multiply (*). For example, 3 + 2 * 2 is evaluated as 3 + (2 * 2). Parentheses may be used to override precedence as in this example: (3 + 2) * 2</p>
<p>Except where noted below, any blank value (empty string) involved in a math operation is <strong>not</strong> assumed to be zero. Instead, it is treated as an error, which causes that part of the expression to evaluate to an empty string. For example, if the variable X is blank, the expression X+1 yields a blank value rather than 1.</p>
<h3>Expression Operators (in descending precedence order)</h3>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <td align="center" style="white-space:nowrap"><strong>%Var%</strong></td>
    <td><p><a name="ref"></a>If a variable is enclosed in percent signs within an expression (e.g. %Var%), whatever that variable <u>contains</u> is assumed to be the name or partial name of another variable (if there is no such variable, %Var% resolves to a blank string). This is most commonly used to reference <a href="misc/Arrays.htm#pseudo">pseudo-array</a> elements such as the following example:</p>
      <pre>Var := MyArray%A_Index% + 100</pre>
      <p>For backward compatibility, command parameters that are documented as &quot;can be an expression&quot; treat an isolated name in percent signs (e.g. %Var%, but not Array%i%) as though the percent signs are absent. This can be avoided by enclosing the reference in parentheses; e.g. <code>Sleep (%Var%)</code></p>
      <p><span class="ver">[AHK_L 52+]:</span> In addition to normal variables, %Var% may resolve to an <a href="#env">environment variable</a>, the clipboard, or any <a href="#BuiltIn">reserved/read-only variable</a>. Prior to revision 52, %Var% yielded an empty string in these cases.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>x.y</strong></td>
    <td><span class="ver">[AHK_L 31+]:</span> <strong>Object access</strong>. Get or set a value or call a method of object <i>x</i>, where <i>y</i> is a literal value. See <a href="Objects.htm#Usage_Objects">object syntax</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>++<br>
    --</strong></td>
    <td><strong><a name="IncDec"></a>Pre- and post-increment/decrement</strong>. Adds or subtracts 1 from a variable (but in versions prior to 1.0.46, these can be used only by themselves on a line; no other operators may be present). The operator may appear either before or after the variable's name. If it appears <em>before</em> the name, the operation is performed immediately and its result is used by the next operation. For example, <em>Var := ++X</em> increments X immediately and then assigns its value to <em>Var</em>. Conversely, if the operator appears <em>after</em> the variable's name, the operation is performed <em>after</em> the variable is used by the next operation. For example, <em>Var := X++</em> increments X only after assigning the current value of X to <em>Var</em>. Due to backward compatibility, the operators ++ and -- treat blank variables as zero, but only when they are alone on a line; for example, <em>y:=1, ++x</em> and <em>MsgBox % ++x</em> both produce a blank result when x is blank.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>**</strong></td>
    <td><a name="pow"></a><strong>Power</strong>. Both the base and the exponent may contain a decimal point. If the exponent is negative, the result  will be formatted as a floating point number even if the base and exponent are both integers. Since ** is of higher precedence than unary minus, -2**2 is evaluated like -(2**2) and so yields -4. Thus, to raise a literal negative number to a power, enclose it in parentheses such as (-2)**2. Note: A negative base combined with a fractional exponent such as (-2)**0.5 is not supported; it will yield an empty string. But both (-2)**2 and (-2)**2.0 are supported.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>-<br>
    !<br>
    ~<br>
    &amp; *</strong></td>
    <td><p><strong><a name="unary"></a>Unary minus (-)</strong>: Although it uses the same symbol as the subtract operator, unary minus applies to only a single item or sub-expression as shown twice in this example: <em><strong>-</strong>(3 / <strong>-</strong>x)</em>. On a related note, any unary plus signs (+) within an expression are ignored.</p>
      <p><strong>Logical-not (!)</strong>: If the operand is blank or 0, the result of applying logical-not is 1, which means &quot;true&quot;. Otherwise, the result is 0 (false). For example: <em>!x or !(y and z)</em>. Note: The word NOT is synonymous with <strong>!</strong> except that <strong>!</strong> has a higher precedence. In v1.0.46+, consecutive unary operators such as <em><strong>!!</strong>Var</em> are allowed because they are evaluated in right-to-left order.</p>
      <p><strong>Bitwise-not (~)</strong>: This inverts each bit of its operand. If the operand is a floating point value, it is truncated to an integer prior to the calculation. If the operand  is between 0 and 4294967295 (0xffffffff), it will be treated as an <u>unsigned</u> 32-bit value. Otherwise, it is treated as a <u>signed</u> 64-bit value. For example, ~0xf0f evaluates to 0xfffff0f0 (4294963440).</p>
      <p><a name="amp"></a><strong>Address (&amp;)</strong>: <em>&amp;MyVar</em> retrieves the address of <em>MyVar</em>'s contents in memory, which is typically used with <a href="commands/DllCall.htm#struct">DllCall structures</a>. <em>&amp;MyVar</em> also disables the caching of binary numbers in that variable, which can slow down its performance if it is ever used for math or numeric comparisons. Caching is re-enabled for a variable whenever its address changes (e.g. via <a href="commands/VarSetCapacity.htm">VarSetCapacity()</a>).</p>
      <p><strong>Dereference (*)</strong>: <em>*Expression </em>assumes that <em>Expression</em> resolves to a numeric memory address; it retrieves the byte at that address as a number between 0 and 255 (0 is always retrieved if the address is 0; but any other invalid address must be avoided because it might crash the script). However, <a href="Functions.htm#NumGet">NumGet()</a> generally performs much better when retrieving binary numbers.</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>*<br>
    /<br>
    //
    </strong></td>
    <td><p><strong>Multiply (*)</strong>: The result is an integer if both inputs are integers; otherwise, it is a floating point number.</p>
      <p><a name="divide"></a><strong>True divide (/)</strong>: Unlike <a href="commands/EnvDiv.htm">EnvDiv</a>, true division yields a floating point result even when both inputs are integers. For example, 3/2 yields 1.5 rather than 1, and 4/2 yields 2.0 rather than 2.</p>
      <p><strong><a name="FloorDivide"></a>Floor divide (//)</strong>: The double-slash operator uses high-performance integer division if the two inputs are integers. For example, 5//3 is 1 and 5//-3 is -1. If either of the inputs is in floating point format, floating point division is performed and the result is truncated to the nearest integer to the left. For example, 5//3.0 is 1.0 and 5.0//-3 is -2.0. Although the result of this floating point division is an integer, it is stored in floating point format so that anything else that uses it will see it as such. For modulo, see <a href="Functions.htm#Mod">mod()</a>.</p>
    <p> The <a href="commands/EnvMult.htm">*=</a> and <a href="commands/EnvDiv.htm">/=</a> operators are a shorthand way to multiply or divide the value in a variable by another value. For example, <em>Var*=2</em> produces the same result as <em>Var:=Var*2</em> (though the former performs better).</p>
    <p>Division by zero yields a blank result (empty string).</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>+<br>

    <td><p><strong>Add (+)</strong> and <strong>subtract (-)</strong>. On a related note, the <a href="commands/EnvAdd.htm"><strong>+=</strong></a> and <a href="commands/EnvSub.htm"><strong>-=</strong></a> operators are a shorthand way to increment or decrement a variable. For example, <em>Var+=2</em> produces the same result as <em>Var:=Var+2</em> (though the former performs better). Similarly, a variable can be increased or decreased by 1 by using <a href="#IncDec">Var++, Var--, ++Var</a>, or <a href="#IncDec">--Var</a>.</p>

    <td><a name="bitwise"></a><strong>Bit shift left (&lt;&lt;)</strong> and <strong>right (&gt;&gt;)</strong>. Example usage: <em>Value1 &lt;&lt; Value2</em>. Any floating point input is truncated to an integer prior to the calculation. Shift left (<strong>&lt;&lt;</strong>) is equivalent to multiplying <em>Value1</em> by &quot;2 to the <em>Value2</em>th power&quot;. Shift right (<strong>&gt;&gt;</strong>) is equivalent to dividing <em>Value1</em> by &quot;2 to the <em>Value2</em>th power&quot; and rounding the result to the nearest integer leftward on the number line; for example, -3&gt;&gt;1 is -2.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>.</strong></td>
    <td><p><a name="concat"></a><strong>Concatenate</strong>. The period (dot) operator is used to combine two items into a single string (there must be at least one space on each side of the period). You may also omit the period to achieve the same result (except where ambiguous such as <em>x <strong>-</strong>y</em>, or when the item on the right side has a leading ++ or --). When the dot is omitted, there should be at least one space between the items to be merged.<br>
      Example (expression method): Var := &quot;The color is &quot; <strong>.</strong> FoundColor<br>
      Example (traditional method): &nbsp;Var = The color is %FoundColor%</p>
        <p> Sub-expressions can also be concatenated. For example: <em>Var := &quot;The net price is &quot; <strong>.</strong>  Price * (1 - Discount/100)</em></p>

    <td><p><strong><a name="AssignOp"></a>Assign</strong>. Performs an operation on the contents of a variable and stores the result back in the same variable (but in versions prior to 1.0.46, these could only be used as the leftmost operator on a line, and only the first five operators were supported). The simplest assignment operator is <a href="commands/SetExpression.htm">colon-equals (:=)</a>, which stores the result of an expression in a variable. For a description of what the other operators do, see their related entries in this table. For example, <em>Var //= 2</em> performs <a href="#FloorDivide">floor division</a> to divide <em>Var</em> by 2, then stores the result back in <em>Var</em>. Similarly, <em>Var <strong>.=</strong> &quot;abc&quot;</em> is a shorthand way of writing <em>Var := Var <strong>.</strong> &quot;abc&quot;</em>.</p>
      <p>Unlike most other operators, assignments are evaluated from right to left. Consequently, a line such as <em>Var1 := Var2 := 0</em> first assigns 0 to <em>Var2</em> then assigns <em>Var2</em> to <em>Var1</em>.</p>      
    <p>If an assignment is used as the input for some other operator, its value is the variable itself. For example,  the expression <em>(Var+=2) &gt; 50</em> is true if the newly-increased value in <em>Var</em> is greater than 50. This also allows an assignment to be passed <a href="Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef,</a> or its <a href="#amp">address</a> taken; for example: <em>&amp;(x:=&quot;abc&quot;)</em>.</p>
    <p>The precedence of the assignment operators is automatically raised when it would avoid a syntax error or provide more intuitive behavior. For example: <em>not x:=y</em> is evaluated as <em>not (x:=y)</em>. Similarly, <em>++Var := X</em> is evaluated as <em>++(Var := X)</em>; and <em> Z&gt;0 ? X:=2 : Y:=2</em> is evaluated as <em>Z&gt;0 ? (X:=2) : (Y:=2)</em></p>
    <p>Known limitations caused by backward compatibility (these may be resolved in a future release): 1) When <strong>/=</strong> is the leftmost operator in an expression and it is not part of a <a href="#comma">multi-statement expression</a>, it performs <a href="#FloorDivide">floor division</a> unless one of the inputs is floating point (in all other cases, <strong>/=</strong> performs <a href="#divide">true division</a>); 2) <a href="commands/EnvAdd.htm">Date/time math</a> is supported by <strong>+=</strong> and <strong>-=</strong> only when that operator is the leftmost one on a line; 3) The operators <strong>+=</strong>, <strong>-=</strong>, and *= treat blank variables as zero, but only when they are alone on a line; for example, <em>y:=1, x+=1</em> and <em>MsgBox % x-=3</em> both produce a blank result when x is blank.</p></td>

    Performance</strong>: <a name="CommaPerf" id="CommaPerf"></a>In v1.0.48+, the comma operator is usually faster than writing separate expressions, especially when assigning one variable to another (e.g. x:=y, a:=b). Performance continues to improve as more and more expressions are combined into a single expression; for example, it may be 35% faster to combine five or ten simple expressions into a single expression.</p>

<h2 id="env">Environment Variables vs. &quot;Normal&quot; Variables</h2>
<p>Environment variables are maintained by the operating system. You can see a list of them at the command prompt by typing SET then pressing Enter.</p>
<p>A script may create a new environment variable or change the contents of an existing one with <a href="commands/EnvSet.htm">EnvSet</a>. However, such additions and changes are private; they are not seen by the rest of the system. One exception is when a script uses <a href="commands/Run.htm">Run</a> or <a href="commands/Run.htm">RunWait</a> to launch a program (even another script): such programs inherit a copy of the parent script's environment variables, including private ones.</p>
<p>In v1.0.43.08+, it is recommended that all new scripts retrieve environment variables such as <em>Path</em> via:</p>
<pre><a href="commands/EnvGet.htm">EnvGet, OutputVar, Path</a>  <em>; For explanation, see <a href="commands/_NoEnv.htm">#NoEnv</a>.</em></pre>
<h2 id="cap">Variable Capacity and Memory</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each variable may contain up to 64 MB of text (this limit can be increased with <a href="commands/_MaxMem.htm">#MaxMem</a>).</li>
  <li>When a variable is given a new string longer than its current contents, additional system memory is allocated automatically.</li>
  <li>The memory occupied by a large variable can be freed by setting it equal to nothing, e.g. var := &quot;&quot;</li>
  <li>There is no limit to how many variables a script may create. The program is designed to support at least several million variables without a significant drop in performance.</li>
  <li>Commands, functions, and expressions that accept numeric inputs generally support 15 digits of precision for floating point values. For integers, 64-bit signed values are supported, which range from -9223372036854775808 (-0x8000000000000000) to 9223372036854775807 (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). Any integer constants outside this range are not supported and might yield inconsistent results. By contrast, arithmetic operations on integers wrap around upon overflow (e.g. 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF + 1 = -0x8000000000000000).</li>
