<h1>FileSelectFolder</h1>

<p>Displays a standard dialog  that allows the user to select a folder.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">FileSelectFolder</span>, OutputVar <span class="optional">, StartingFolder, Options, Prompt</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the variable in which to store the user's selected folder. This will be made blank if the user cancels the dialog (i.e. does not wish to select a folder). If the user selects a root directory (such as C:\), <em>OutputVar</em> will contain a trailing backslash. If this is undesirable, remove it as follows:</p>
      <pre>FileSelectFolder, Folder
Folder := RegExReplace(Folder, "\\$")  <em>; Removes the trailing backslash, if present.</em></pre></dd>

  <dt>StartingFolder</dt>
  <dd><p>If blank or omitted, the dialog's initial selection will be the user's My Documents folder (or possibly My Computer). A <a href="../misc/CLSID-List.htm">CLSID folder</a> such as <code>::{20d04fe0-3aea-1069-a2d8-08002b30309d}</code> (i.e. My Computer) may be specified start navigation at a specific special folder.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the most common usage of this parameter is an asterisk followed immediately by the absolute path of the drive or folder to be initially selected. For example, <code>*C:\</code> would initially select the C drive. Similarly, <code>*C:\My Folder</code> would initially select that particular folder.</p>
      <p>The asterisk indicates that the user is permitted to navigate upward (closer to the root) from the starting folder. Without the asterisk, the user would be forced to select a folder inside <em>StartingFolder</em> (or <em>StartingFolder</em> itself). One benefit of omitting the asterisk is that <em>StartingFolder</em> is initially shown in a tree-expanded state, which may save the user from having to click the first plus sign.</p>
      <p>If the asterisk is present, upward navigation may optionally be restricted to a folder other than Desktop. This is done by preceding the asterisk with the absolute path of the uppermost folder followed by exactly one space or tab. For example, <code>C:\My Folder *C:\My Folder\Projects</code> would not allow the user to navigate any higher than C:\My Folder (but the initial selection would be C:\My Folder\Projects).</p>
    </dd>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd><p>One of the following numbers:</p>
      <p><strong>0</strong>: The options below are all disabled (except on Windows 2000, where the "make new folder" button might appear anyway).</p>
      <p><strong>1</strong> (default): A button is provided that allows the user to create new folders.</p>
      <p><strong>Add 2</strong> to the above number to  provide an edit field that allows the user to type the name of a folder. For example, a value of 3 for this parameter provides both an edit field and a "make new folder" button.</p>
      <p id="NewDialog"><strong>Add 4</strong> to the above number to omit the BIF_NEWDIALOGSTYLE property. Adding 4 ensures that FileSelectFolder will work properly even in a Preinstallation Environment like WinPE or BartPE. However, this prevents the appearance of a "make new folder" button, at least on Windows XP. ["4" requires v1.0.48+]</p>
      <p>If the user types an invalid folder name in the edit field, <em>OutputVar</em> will be set to the folder selected in the navigation tree rather than what the user entered, at least on Windows XP.</p>
      <p>This parameter can be an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>Prompt</dt>
  <dd><p>Text displayed in the window to instruct the user what to do. If omitted or blank, it will default to "Select Folder - %A_ScriptName%" (i.e. the name of the current script).</p></dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span>: This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1 if the user dismissed the dialog without selecting a folder (such as by pressing the Cancel button). It is also set to 1 if the system refused to show the dialog (rare). Otherwise, it is set to 0.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A folder-selection dialog usually looks like this:</p>
<img src="../static/dlg_folder.png" alt="FileSelectFolder" />
<p>A GUI window may display a modal folder-selection dialog by means of <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">Gui +OwnDialogs</a>. A modal dialog prevents the user from interacting with the GUI window until the dialog is dismissed.</p>
<p>Known limitation: A <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a> that launches during the display of a FileSelectFolder dialog will postpone the effect of the user's clicks inside the dialog until after the timer finishes. To work around this, avoid using timers whose subroutines take a long time to finish, or disable all timers during the dialog:</p>
<pre><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a>, NoTimers
FileSelectFolder, OutputVar,, 3
Thread, NoTimers, false</pre>

<p>Also, the operating system offers standard dialog boxes that prompt the user to pick a font, color, or icon. These dialogs can be displayed via <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall()</a> as demonstrated at <a href="https://github.com/majkinetor/mm-autohotkey/tree/master/Dlg">GitHub</a>.</p>
