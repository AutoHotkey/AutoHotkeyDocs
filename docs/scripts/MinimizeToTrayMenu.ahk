; Minimize Window to Tray Menu
; https://www.autohotkey.com
; This script assigns a hotkey of your choice to hide any window so that
; it becomes an entry at the bottom of the script's tray menu.  Hidden
; windows can then be unhidden individually or all at once by selecting
; the corresponding item on the menu.  If the script exits for any reason,
; all the windows that it hid will be unhidden automatically.

; CONFIGURATION SECTION: Change the below values as desired.

; This is the maximum number of windows to allow to be hidden (having a
; limit helps performance):
global g_MaxWindows := 50

; This is the hotkey used to hide the active window:
global g_Hotkey := "#h"  ; Win+H

; This is the hotkey used to unhide the last hidden window:
global g_UnHotkey := "#u"  ; Win+U

; If you prefer to have the tray menu empty of all the standard items,
; such as Help and Pause, use False. Otherwise, use True:
global g_StandardMenu := false

; These next few performance settings help to keep the action within the
; #HotkeyModifierTimeout period, and thus avoid the need to release and
; press down the hotkey's modifier if you want to hide more than one
; window in a row. These settings are not needed you choose to have the
; script use the keyboard hook via #InstallKeybdHook or other means:
#HotkeyModifierTimeout 100
SetWinDelay 10
SetKeyDelay 0

#SingleInstance  ; Allow only one instance of this script to be running.

; END OF CONFIGURATION SECTION (do not make changes below this point
; unless you want to change the basic functionality of the script).

    ; Because hiding the window won't deactivate it, activate the window
    ; beneath this one (if any). I tried other ways, but they wound up
    ; activating the task bar. This way sends the active window (which is
    ; about to be hidden) to the back of the stack, which seems best:
    Send "!{esc}"
    ; Hide it only now that WinGetTitle/WinGetClass above have been run (since
    ; by default, those functions cannot detect hidden windows):
    WinHide

    ; If the title is blank, use the class instead. This serves two purposes:
    ; 1) A more meaningful name is used as the menu name.
    ; 2) Allows the menu item to be created (otherwise, blank items wouldn't
    ;    be handled correctly by the various routines below).

    ; unique, it must also be unique so that we can reliably look it up in
    ; the array when the window is later unhidden. So make it unique if it
    ; isn't already:
    for WindowTitle in g_WindowTitles
    {
        if WindowTitle = ActiveTitle
        {
            ; Match found, so it's not unique.

            ActiveTitleLength += ActiveIDShortLength
            ActiveTitleLength += 1 ; +1 the 1 space between title & ID.
            if ActiveTitleLength > g_MaxLength
            {
                ; Since menu item names are limted in length, trim the title
                ; down to allow just enough room for the Window's Short ID at
                ; the end of its name:
                TrimCount := ActiveTitleLength
                TrimCount -= g_MaxLength
                ActiveTitle := SubStr(ActiveTitle, 1, -TrimCount)
