<h1>AutoHotkey Script Showcase</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.enovatic.org/products/niftywindows/introduction/">NiftyWindows -- by Enovatic-Solutions</a>: This script gives you easy control of all basic window interactions such as dragging, resizing, maximizing, minimizing and closing. Its most powerful feature is activated by dragging with the right mouse button. Visualize each window divided into a virtual 9-cell grid with three columns and rows. The center cell is the largest one: you can grab and move a window around by clicking and holding it with the right mouse button. The other eight cells are used to resize a window in the same manner. NiftyWindows also offers snap-to-grid, &quot;keep window aspect ratio&quot;, rolling up a window to its title bar, transparency control, and other useful shortcuts.
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic11700.html">Screen Magnifier -- by Holomind</a>: This screen magnifier has the several advantages over the one included with the operating system, including: Customizable refresh interval and zoom level (including shrink/de-magnify); antialiasing to provide nicer output; and it is open-source (as a result, there are several variations to choose from, or you can tweak the script yourself).
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic11588.html">LiveWindows: Watch Dialog-boxes in Thumbnail -- by Holomind</a>: This script allows you to monitor the progress of downloads, file-copying, and other dialogs by displaying a small replica of each dialog and its progress bar (dialogs are automatically detected, even if they're behind other windows). The preview window stays always-on-top but uses very little screen space (it can also be resized by dragging its edges). You can also monitor any window by dragging a selection rectangle around the area of interest (with control-shift-drag), then press Win+W to display that section in the preview window with real-time updates.
</p>
<p><a href="MouseGestures.htm">Mouse Gestures -- by deguix</a>: This script watches how you move the mouse whenever the right mouse button is being held down.  If it sees you &quot;draw&quot; a recognized shape or symbol, it will launch a program or perform another custom action of your choice (just like hotkeys).  See the included README file for how to define gestures.
</p>
<p><a href="ContextSensitiveHelp.htm">Context Sensitive Help in Any Editor -- by Rajat</a>:  This script makes Ctrl+2 (or another hotkey of your choice) show the help file
 page for the selected AutoHotkey command or keyword. If nothing is selected,
 the command name will be extracted from the beginning of the current line.
</p>
<p><a href="EasyWindowDrag.htm">Easy Window Dragging (requires XP/2k/NT)</a>:  Normally, a window can only be dragged by clicking on its title bar.
 This script extends that so that any point inside a window can be dragged.
 To activate this mode, hold down CapsLock or the middle mouse button while
 clicking, then drag the window to a new position.
</p>
<p><a href="EasyWindowDrag_(KDE).htm">Easy Window Dragging -- KDE style (requires XP/2k/NT) -- by Jonny</a>:  This script makes it much easier to move or resize a window: 1) Hold down
 the ALT key and LEFT-click anywhere inside a window to drag it to a new
 location; 2) Hold down ALT and RIGHT-click-drag anywhere inside a window
 to easily resize it; 3) Press ALT twice, but before releasing it the second
 time, left-click to minimize the window under the mouse cursor, right-click
 to maximize it, or middle-click to close it.
</p>
<p><a href="FavoriteFolders.htm">Easy Access to Favorite Folders -- by Savage</a>:  When you click the middle mouse button while certain types of
 windows are active, this script displays a menu of your favorite
 folders.  Upon selecting a favorite, the script will instantly
 switch to that folder within the active window.  The following
 window types are supported: 1) Standard file-open or file-save
 dialogs; 2) Explorer windows; 3) Console (command prompt) windows.
 The menu can also be optionally shown for unsupported window
 types, in which case the chosen favorite will be opened as a new
 Explorer window.
</p>
<p><a href="IntelliSense.htm">IntelliSense -- by Rajat (requires XP/2k/NT)</a>:  This script watches while you edit an AutoHotkey script.  When it sees you
 type a command followed by a comma or space, it displays that command's
 parameter list to guide you.  In addition, you can press Ctrl+F1 (or
 another hotkey of your choice) to display that command's page in the help
 file. To dismiss the parameter list, press Escape or Enter.
</p>
<p><a href="JoystickMouse.htm">Using a Joystick as a Mouse</a>:  This script converts a joystick into a three-button mouse.  It allows each
 button to drag just like a mouse button and it uses virtually no CPU time.
 Also, it will move the cursor faster depending on how far you push the joystick
 from center. You can personalize various settings at the top of the script.
</p>
<p><a href="JoystickTest.htm">Joystick Test Script</a>:  This script helps determine the button numbers and other attributes
 of your joystick. It might also reveal if your joystick is in need
 of calibration; that is, whether the range of motion of each of its
 axes is from 0 to 100 percent as it should be. If calibration is
 needed, use the operating system's control panel or the software
 that came with your joystick.
</p>
<p><a href="KeyboardOnScreen.htm">On-Screen Keyboard (requires XP/2k/NT) -- by Jon</a>:  This script creates a mock keyboard at the bottom of your screen that shows
 the keys you are pressing in real time. I made it to help me to learn to
 touch-type (to get used to not looking at the keyboard).  The size of the
 on-screen keyboard can be customized at the top of the script. Also, you
 can double-click the tray icon to show or hide the keyboard.
</p>
<p><a href="MinimizeToTrayMenu.htm">Minimize Window to Tray Menu</a>:  This script assigns a hotkey of your choice to hide any window so that
 it becomes an entry at the bottom of the script's tray menu.  Hidden
 windows can then be unhidden individually or all at once by selecting
 the corresponding item on the menu.  If the script exits for any reason,
 all the windows that it hid will be unhidden automatically.
</p>
<p><a href="MsgBoxButtonNames.htm">Changing MsgBox's Button Names</a>:  This is a working example script that uses a timer to change
 the names of the buttons in a MsgBox dialog. Although the button
 names are changed, the IfMsgBox command still requires that the
 buttons be referred to by their original names.
</p>
<p><a href="Numpad000.htm">Numpad 000 Key</a>:  This example script makes the special 000 key that appears on certain
 keypads into an equals key.  You can change the action by replacing the
 <code>Send, =</code> line with line(s) of your choice.
</p>
<p><a href="NumpadMouse.htm">Using Keyboard Numpad as a Mouse -- by deguix</a>:  This script makes mousing with your keyboard almost as easy
 as using a real mouse (maybe even easier for some tasks).
 It supports up to five mouse buttons and the turning of the
 mouse wheel.  It also features customizable movement speed,
 acceleration, and &quot;axis inversion&quot;.
</p>
<p><a href="Seek_(SearchTheStartMenu).htm">Seek -- by Phi</a>:  Navigating the Start Menu can be a hassle, especially
 if you have installed many programs over time. 'Seek'
 lets you specify a case-insensitive key word/phrase
 that it will use to filter only the matching programs
 and directories from the Start Menu, so that you can
 easily open your target program from a handful of
 matched entries. This eliminates the drudgery of
 searching and traversing the Start Menu.
</p>
<p><a href="TooltipMouseMenu.htm">ToolTip Mouse Menu (requires XP/2k/NT) -- by Rajat</a>:  This script displays a popup menu in response to briefly holding down
 the middle mouse button.  Select a menu item by left-clicking it.
 Cancel the menu by left-clicking outside of it.  A recent improvement
 is that the contents of the menu can change depending on which type of
 window is active (Notepad and Word are used as examples here).
</p>
<p><a href="VolumeOSD.htm">Volume On-Screen-Display (OSD) -- by Rajat</a>:  This script assigns hotkeys of your choice to raise and lower the
 master and/or wave volume.  Both volumes are displayed as different
 color bar graphs.
</p>
<p><a href="WindowShading.htm">Window Shading (roll up a window to its title bar) -- by Rajat</a>:  This script reduces a window to its title bar and then back to its
 original size by pressing a single hotkey.  Any number of windows
 can be reduced in this fashion (the script remembers each).  If the
 script exits for any reason, all &quot;rolled up&quot; windows will be
 automatically restored to their original heights.
</p>
<p><a href="WinLIRC.htm">WinLIRC Client</a>:  This script receives notifications from <a href="http://winlirc.sourceforge.net">WinLIRC</a> whenever you press
 a button on your remote control. It can be used to automate Winamp,
 Windows Media Player, etc. It's easy to configure. For example, if
 WinLIRC recognizes a button named &quot;VolUp&quot; on your remote control,
 create a label named VolUp and beneath it use the command
 <code>SoundSet +5</code> to increase the soundcard's volume by 5%.
</p>
