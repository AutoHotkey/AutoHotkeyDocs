<h1>Window Shading (roll up a window to its title bar) -- by Rajat</h1>

<p>This script reduces a window to its title bar and then back to its
 original size by pressing a single hotkey.  Any number of windows
 can be reduced in this fashion (the script remembers each).  If the
 script exits for any reason, all &quot;rolled up&quot; windows will be
 automatically restored to their original heights.
