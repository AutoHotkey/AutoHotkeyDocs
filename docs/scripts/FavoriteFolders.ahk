; Easy Access to Favorite Folders -- by Savage
; http://www.autohotkey.com
; When you click the middle mouse button while certain types of
; windows are active, this script displays a menu of your favorite
; folders.  Upon selecting a favorite, the script will instantly
; switch to that folder within the active window.  The following
; window types are supported: 1) Standard file-open or file-save
; dialogs; 2) Explorer windows; 3) Console (command prompt) windows.
; The menu can also be optionally shown for unsupported window
; types, in which case the chosen favorite will be opened as a new
; Explorer window.

; CONFIG: CHOOSE YOUR HOTKEY
; If your mouse has more than 3 buttons, you could try using
; XButton1 (the 4th) or XButton2 (the 5th) instead of MButton.
; You could also use a modified mouse button (such as ^MButton) or
; a keyboard hotkey.  In the case of MButton, the tilde (~) prefix
; is used so that MButton's normal functionality is not lost when
; you click in other window types, such as a browser.  The presence
; of a tilde tells the script to avoid showing the menu for
; unsupported window types.  In other words, if there is no tilde,
; the hotkey will always display the menu; and upon selecting a
; favorite while an unsupported window type is active, a new
; Explorer window will be opened to display the contents of that
; folder.
f_Hotkey := "~MButton"

; CONFIG: CHOOSE YOUR FAVORITES
; Update the special commented section below to list your favorite
; folders.  Specify the name of the menu item first, followed by a
; semicolon, followed by the name of the actual path of the favorite.
; Use a blank line to create a separator line.
