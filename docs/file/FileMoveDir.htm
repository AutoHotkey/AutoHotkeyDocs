<h1>FileMoveDir</h1>

<p>Moves a folder along with all its sub-folders and files. It can also rename a folder.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">FileMoveDir</span>, Source, Dest <span class="optional">, Flag</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Source</dt>
  <dd><p>Name of the source directory (with no trailing backslash), which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">%A_WorkingDir%</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. For example: C:\My Folder</p></dd>

  <dt>Dest</dt>
  <dd><p>The new path and name of the directory (with no trailing baskslash), which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">%A_WorkingDir%</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. For example: D:\My Folder.</p>
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Dest</em> is the actual path and name that the directory will have after it is moved; it is <em>not</em> the directory into which <em>Source</em> is moved (except for the known limitation mentioned below).</p></dd>

  <dt>Flag</dt>
  <dd><p>(options) Specify one of the following single characters:</p>
      <p><strong>0</strong> (default): Do not overwrite existing files. The operation will fail if <em>Dest</em> already exists as a file or directory.</p>
      <p><strong>1</strong>: Overwrite existing files. However, any files or subfolders inside <em>Dest</em> that do not have a counterpart in <em>Source</em> will not be deleted. <strong>Known limitation:</strong> If <em>Dest</em> already exists as a folder and it is on the same volume as <em>Source</em>, <em>Source</em> will be moved into it rather than overwriting it. To avoid this, see the next option.</p>
      <p><strong>2</strong>: The same as mode 1 above except that the limitation is absent.</p>
      <p><strong>R</strong>: Rename the directory rather than moving it. Although renaming normally has the same effect as moving, it is helpful in cases where you want "all or none" behavior; that is, when you don't want the operation to be only partially successful when <em>Source</em> or one of its files is locked (in use). Although this method cannot move <em>Source</em> onto a different volume, it can move it to any other directory on its own volume. The operation will fail if <em>Dest</em> already exists as a file or directory.</p></dd>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span>: This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1 if there was a problem or 0 otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>FileMoveDir moves a single folder to a new location. To instead move the contents of a folder (all its files and subfolders), see the examples section of <a href="FileMove.htm">FileMove</a>.</p>
<p>If the source and destination are on different volumes or UNC paths, a copy/delete operation will be performed rather than a move.</p>
