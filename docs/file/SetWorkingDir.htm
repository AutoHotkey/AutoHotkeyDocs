<h1>SetWorkingDir</h1>

<p>Changes the script's current working directory.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SetWorkingDir</span>, DirName</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>DirName</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the new working directory, which is assumed to be a subfolder of the current <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">%A_WorkingDir%</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Error_Handling">Error Handling</h2>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span>: This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1 if there was a problem or 0 otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The script's working directory is the default directory that is used to access files and folders when an absolute path has not been specified. In the following example, the file <em>My Filename.txt</em> is assumed to be in %A_WorkingDir%: <code><a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>, A Line of Text, My Filename.txt</code>.</p>
<p>A script's initial working directory is determined by how it was launched. For example, if it was run via shortcut -- such as on the Start Menu -- its working directory is determined by the "Start in" field within the shortcut's properties.</p>
<p>To make a script unconditionally use its own folder as its working directory, make its first line the following:</p>
<pre>SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%</pre>
<p>Once changed, the new working directory is instantly and globally in effect throughout the script. All interrupted, <a href="Pause.htm">paused</a>, and newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> are affected, including <a href="SetTimer.htm">Timers</a>.</p>
