<h2 id="s1">1 - The Basics</h2>
<p class="note">Before we begin our journey, let me give some advice. Throughout this tutorial you will see a lot of text and a lot of code. For optimal learning power, it is advised that you read the text and <b>try</b> the code. Then, study the code. You can copy and paste most examples on this page. If you get confused, try reading the section again.</p>

<h3 id="s11">a. Downloading and installing AutoHotkey</h3>
<p id="local_note" class="note" style="display: none">Since you're viewing this documentation locally, you've probably already installed AutoHotkey and can skip to section b.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
  if ('file:mk:ms-its:'.indexOf(location.protocol) != -1)
    document.getElementById("local_note").removeAttribute("style");
</script>
<p>Before learning to use AutoHotkey (AHK), you will need to download it. After downloading it, you may possibly need to install it. But that depends on the version you want. For this guide we will use the Installer since it is easiest to set up.</p>
<p class="warning">Currently there is no installer for AutoHotkey v2. The easiest way to get it work is to <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/">download the binaries</a>, follow the installation steps below, and replace AutoHotkey.exe with the downloaded binaries inside the installation folder.</p>

<p>Text instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the AutoHotkey Homepage: <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">https://www.autohotkey.com/</a></li>
    <li>Click Download: <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe">https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe</a></li>
    <li>During installation of AutoHotkey, you will be asked to choose from UNICODE or ANSI. In short, you would probably want to choose UNICODE. It has support for non-English letters and numbers (characters). Keep going until you see an Install button.</li>
    <li>Once done, great! Continue on to section b.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note">For a video instruction, watch
<a href="https://youtu.be/HcgQlGeaPHw">Install and Hello World</a> on YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="s12">b. How to create a script</h3>
<p>Once you have AutoHotkey installed, you will probably want it to do stuff. AutoHotkey is not magic, we all wish it was, but it is not. So we will need to tell it what to do. This process is called "Scripting".</p>

<p>Text instructions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Right-Click on your desktop.</li>
    <li>Find "New" in the menu.</li>
    <li>Click "AutoHotkey Script" inside the "New" menu.</li>
    <li>Give the script a new name. It must end with a .ahk extension. For example: MyScript.ahk</li>
    <li>Find the newly created file on your desktop and right-click it.</li>
    <li>Click "Edit Script".</li>
    <li>A window should have popped up, probably Notepad. If so, SUCCESS!
    <p>So now that you have created a script, we need to add stuff into the file. For a list of all built-in function and variables, see <a href="#s5">section 5</a>.</p>
    <p>Here is a very basic script containing a hotkey which types text using the <a href="commands/Send.htm">Send</a> function when the hotkey is pressed:</p>
    <pre>
^j::
{
    Send "My First Script"
}</pre>
    <p>We will get more in-depth later on. Until then, here's an explanation of the above code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>^j::</code> is the hotkey. <code>^</code> means <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <code>j</code> is the letter <kbd>J</kbd>. Anything to the <b>left</b> of <code>::</code> are the keys you need to press.</li>
        <li><code>Send "My First Script"</code> is how you <strong>send</strong> keystrokes. <code>Send</code> is the function, anything after the space inside the quotes will be typed.</li>
        <li><code>{</code> and <code>}</code> marks the start and end of the <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Save the File.</li>
    <li>Double-click the file/icon in the desktop to run it. Open notepad or (anything you can type in) and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>J</kbd>.</li>
    <li>Hip Hip Hooray! Your first script is done. Go get some reward snacks then return to reading the rest of this tutorial.</li>
</ol><p class="note">For a video instruction, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/HcgQlGeaPHw">Install and Hello World</a> on YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="s14">c. How to find the help file on your computer</h3>
<p>Downloads for v2.0-a076 and later include an offline help file.  Currently there is no installer for v2, so the help file is wherever you put it.</p>
<p>Look for <b>AutoHotkey.chm</b> or a file that says AutoHotkey and has a yellow question mark on it.</p><!-- <p>There are a few ways to do this, I'll assume you have it installed to the default locations:</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Find the Start menu or Start Orb on your screen, usually in the lower left.</li>
    <li>Click <b>Programs</b> or <b>All Programs</b>.</li>
    <li>Find <b>AutoHotkey</b> in the list.</li>
    <li>You should then see <b>AutoHotkey Help File</b>. Click it.</li>
    <li>Done!</li>
</ol>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to your desktop.</li>
    <li>Find <b>My Computer</b> or <b>Computer</b>. Open it.</li>
    <li>Go into your harddrive that contains <b>AutoHotkey</b>. Probably <b>C:\</b> drive.</li>
    <li>Search within all <b>Program Files</b> folders for <b>AutoHotkey</b>.</li>
    <li>Look for <b>AutoHotkey.chm</b> or a file that says AutoHotkey and has a yellow question mark on it.</li>
    <li>Done!</li>
</ol> -->
<h2 id="s2">2 - Hotkeys &amp; Hotstrings</h2>

<p>What is a hotkey? A hotkey is a key that is hot to the touch. ... Just kidding. It is a key or key combination that the person at the keyboard presses to trigger some actions. For example:</p>
<pre>^j::
{
    Send "My First Script"
}</pre>
<p>What is a hotstring? Hotstrings are mainly used to expand abbreviations as you type them (auto-replace), they can also be used to launch any scripted action. For example:</p>
<pre>::ftw::Free the whales</pre>
<p>The difference between the two examples is that the hotkey will be triggered when you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> while the hotstring will convert your typed "ftw" into "Free the whales".</p>
<p><i>"So, how exactly does a person such as myself create a hotkey?"</i> Good question. A hotkey is created by using a single pair of colons. The key or key combo needs to go on the <b>left</b> of the <code>::</code>. And the content needs to go below, enclosed in curly brackets.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There are exceptions, but those tend to cause confusion a lot of the time. So it won't be covered in the tutorial, at least, not right now.</p>
<pre>Esc::
{
    MsgBox "Escape!!!!"
}</pre>
<p>A hotstring has a pair of colons on each side of the text you want to trigger the text replacement. While the text to replace your typed text goes on the <b>right</b> of the second pair of colons.</p>
<p>Hotstrings, as mentioned above, can also launch scripted actions. That's fancy talk for <i>"do pretty much anything"</i>. Same with hotkeys.</p>
<pre>::btw::
{
    MsgBox "You typed btw."
}</pre>
<p>A nice thing to know is that you can have many lines of code for each hotkey, hotstring, label, and a lot of other things we haven't talked about yet.</p>
<pre>^j::
{
    MsgBox "Wow!"
    MsgBox "There are"
    Run "notepad.exe"
    WinActivate "Untitled - Notepad"
    WinWaitActive "Untitled - Notepad"
    Send "7 lines{!}{Enter}"
    SendInput "inside the CTRL{+}J hotkey."
}</pre>

<h3 id="s21">a. Keys and their mysterious symbols</h3>
<p>You might be wondering <i>"How the crud am I supposed to know that ^ means <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>?!"</i>. Well, good question. To help you learn what ^ and other symbols mean, gaze upon this chart:</p>
<table class="info">
    <tr>
        <th class="center">Symbol</th>
        <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">#</td>
        <td><kbd>Win</kbd> (Windows logo key)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">!</td>
        <td><kbd>Alt</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">^</td>
        <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">+</td>
        <td><kbd>Shift</kbd></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">&amp;</td>
        <td>An ampersand may be used between any two keys or mouse buttons to combine them into a custom hotkey.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p><strong>(For the full list of symbols, see the <a href="Hotkeys.htm">Hotkey</a> page)</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, for a list of all/most hotkey names that can be used on the <b>left</b> side of a hotkey's double-colon, see <a href="KeyList.htm">List of Keys, Mouse Buttons, and Joystick Controls</a>.</p>
<p>You can define a custom combination of two (and only two) keys (except joystick buttons) by using <code>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;</code> between them. In the example below, you would hold down Numpad0 then press Numpad1 or Numpad2 to trigger one of the hotkeys:</p>

<pre>Numpad0 &amp; Numpad1::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed Numpad1 while holding down Numpad0."
}

Numpad0 &amp; Numpad2::
{
    Run "notepad.exe"
}</pre>

<p>But you are now wondering if hotstrings have any cool modifiers since hotkeys do. Yes, they do! Hotstring modifiers go between the first set of colons. For example:</p>
<pre>:*:ftw::Free the whales</pre>

<p class="note">Visit <a href="Hotkeys.htm">Hotkeys</a> and <a href="Hotstrings.htm">Hotstrings</a> for additional hotkey and hotstring modifiers, information and examples.</p>
<h3 id="s22">b. Window specific hotkeys/hotstrings</h3>

<p>Sometime you might want a hotkey or hotstring to only work (or be disabled) in a certain window. To do this, you will need to use one of the fancy commands with a # in-front of them, namely <a href="commands/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a>, combined with the built-in function <a href="commands/WinActive.htm">WinActive</a> or <a href="commands/WinExist.htm">WinExist</a>:</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActivate(WinTitle)
#HotIf WinExist(WinTitle)</pre>
<p>This special command (technically called "directive") creates context-sensitive hotkeys and hotstrings. Simply specify a window title for <var>WinTitle</var>. But in some cases you might want to specify criteria such as HWND, group or class. Those are a bit advanced and are covered more in-depth here: <a href="misc/WinTitle.htm">The WinTitle Parameter &amp; the Last Found Window</a>.</p>
<pre>#HotIf WinActive("Untitled - Notepad")
#Space::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed WIN+SPACE in Notepad."
}</pre>
<p>To turn off context sensitivity for subsequent hotkeys or hotstrings, specify #HotIf without its parameter. For example:</p><pre><em>; Untitled - Notepad</em>
#HotIf WinActive("Untitled - Notepad")
!q::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed ALT+Q in Notepad."
}

<em>; Any window that isn't Untitled - Notepad</em>
#HotIf
!q::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed ALT+Q in any window."
}
</pre>
<p>When #HotIf directives are never used in a script, all hotkeys and hotstrings are enabled for all windows.</p>
<p>The #HotIf directive is positional: it affects all hotkeys and hotstrings physically beneath it in the script, until the next #HotIf directive.</p>
<pre><em>; Notepad</em>
#HotIf WinActive("ahk_class Notepad")
#Space::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed WIN+SPACE in Notepad."
}
::msg::You typed msg in Notepad

<em>; MSPaint</em>
#HotIf WinActive("Untitled - Paint")
#Space::
{
    MsgBox "You pressed WIN+SPACE in MSPaint!"
}
::msg::You typed msg in MSPaint!</pre>
<p class="note">For more in-depth information, check out the <a href="commands/_HotIf.htm">#HotIf</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="s23">c. Multiple hotkeys/hotstrings per file</h3>
<p>This, for some reason crosses some people's minds. So I'll set it clear: AutoHotkey has the ability to have <i>as many</i> hotkeys and hotstrings in one file as you want. Whether it's 1, or 3253 (or more).</p>
<pre>#i::
{
    Run "https://www.google.com/"
}

^p::
{
    Run "notepad.exe"
}

~j::
{
    Send "ack"
}

:*:acheiv::achiev
::achievment::achievement
::acquaintence::acquaintance
:*:adquir::acquir
::aquisition::acquisition
:*:agravat::aggravat
:*:allign::align
::ameria::America</pre>
<p>The above code is perfectly acceptable. Multiple hotkeys, multiple hotstrings. All in one big happy script file.</p>

<h3 id="s24">d. Examples</h3>
<pre class="NoIndent">::btw::by the way  <em>; Replaces "btw" with "by the way" as soon as you press an <a href="Hotstrings.htm#EndChars">default ending character</a>.</em></pre>
<pre class="NoIndent">:*:btw::by the way  <em>; Replaces "btw" with "by the way" without needing an ending character.</em></pre>
<pre class="NoIndent">^n::  <em>; CTRL+N hotkey</em>
{
    Run "notepad.exe"  <em>; Run Notepad when you press CTRL+N.</em>
}  <em>; This ends the hotkey. The code below this will not be executed when pressing the hotkey.</em></pre>
<pre class="NoIndent">^b::  <em>; CTRL+B hotkey</em>
{
    Send "{Ctrl down}c{Ctrl up}"  <em>; Copies the selected text. ^c could be used as well, but this method is more secure.</em>
    SendInput "[b]{Ctrl down}v{Ctrl up}[/b]" <em>; Wraps the selected text in BBCode tags to make it bold in a forum.</em>
}  <em>; This ends the hotkey. The code below this will not be executed when pressing the hotkey.</em></pre>

<h2 id="s3">3 - Sending Keystrokes</h2>
<p>So now you decided that you want to send (type) keys to a program. We can do that. Use the <a href="commands/Send.htm">Send</a> function. This function literally sends keystrokes, to simulate typing or pressing of keys.</p>
<p>But before we get into things, we should talk about some common issues that people have.</p>
<p>Just like hotkeys, the Send function has special keys too. <a href="commands/Send.htm">Lots and lots of them</a>. Here are the four most common symbols:</p>
<table class="info">
    <tr>
        <th class="center">Symbol</th>
        <th abbr="Descr">Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">!</td>
        <td>Sends <kbd>Alt</kbd>. For example, <code>Send "This is text!a"</code> would send the keys "This is text" and then press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. <strong>Note</strong>: <code>!A</code> produces a different effect in some programs than <code>!a</code>. This is because <code>!A</code> presses <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and <code>!a</code> presses <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. If in doubt, use lowercase.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">+</td>
        <td>Sends <kbd>Shift</kbd>. For example, <code>Send "+abC"</code> would send the text "AbC", and <code>Send "!+a"</code> would press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">^</td>
        <td>Sends <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>. For example, <code>Send "^!a"</code> would press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>, and <code>Send "^{Home}"</code> would send <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Home</kbd>. <strong>Note</strong>: <code>^A</code> produces a different effect in some programs than <code>^a</code>. This is because <code>^A</code> presses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and <code>^a</code> presses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>. If in doubt, use lowercase.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="center bold">#</td>
        <td>Sends <kbd>Win</kbd> (the key with the Windows logo) therefore <code>Send "#e"</code> would hold down <kbd>Win</kbd> and then press <kbd>E</kbd>.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>The <a href="commands/Send.htm">gigantic table on the Send page</a> shows pretty much every special key built-in to AHK. For example: <code>{Enter}</code> and <code>{Space}</code>.</p>
<p class="warning"><strong>Caution:</strong> This table <b>does not</b> apply to <a href="Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>. Meaning, you do not wrap <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or any other key) inside curly brackets when making a hotkey.</p>
<p>An example showing what shouldn't be done to a hotkey:</p>
<pre><em>; When making a hotkey...
; WRONG</em>
{LCtrl}::
{
    Send "AutoHotkey"
}

<em>; CORRECT</em>
LCtrl::
{
    Send "AutoHotkey"
}
</pre>
<p>A common issue lots of people have is, they assume that the curly brackets are put in the documentation pages just for fun. But in fact <b>they are needed</b>. It's how AHK knows that <code>{!}</code> means "exclamation point" and not "press <kbd>Alt</kbd>". So please remember to check the table on the <a href="commands/Send.htm">Send</a> page and make sure you have your brackets in the right places. For example:</p>
<pre>Send "This text has been typed{!}" <em>; Notice the ! between the curly brackets? That's because if it wasn't, AHK would press the ALT key.</em>
</pre>
<pre><em>; Same as above, but with the ENTER key. AHK would type out "Enter" if
; it wasn't wrapped in curly brackets.</em>
Send "Multiple Enter lines have Enter been sent." <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "Multiple{Enter}lines have{Enter}been sent." <em>; CORRECT</em>
</pre>
<p>Another common issue is that people think that <b>everything</b> needs to be wrapped in brackets with the Send function. That is FALSE. If it's not in the chart, it does not need brackets. You do <b>not</b> need to wrap common letters, numbers or even some symbols such as <code>.</code> (period) in curly brackets. Also, with the Send functions you are able to send more than one letter, number or symbol at a time. So no need for a bunch of Send functions with one letter each. For example:</p>
<pre>Send "{a}"       <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "{b}"       <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "{c}"       <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "{a}{b}{c}" <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "{abc}"     <em>; WRONG</em>
Send "abc"       <em>; CORRECT</em></pre>

<p>To hold down or release a key, enclose the key name in curly brackets and then use the word UP or DOWN. For example:</p>
<pre><em>; This is how you hold one key down and press another key (or keys).
; If one method doesn't work in your program, please try the other.</em>
Send "^s"                     <em>; Both of these send CTRL+S</em>
Send "{Ctrl down}s{Ctrl up}"  <em>; Both of these send CTRL+S</em>
Send "{Ctrl down}c{Ctrl up}"
Send "{b down}{b up}"
Send "{Tab down}{Tab up}"
Send "{Up down}"  <em>; Press down the up-arrow key.</em>
Sleep 1000        <em>; Keep it down for one second.</em>
Send "{Up up}"    <em>; Release the up-arrow key.</em></pre>

<p>But now you are wondering <i>"How can I make my really long Send functions readable?"</i>. Easy. Use what is known as a continuation section. Simply specify an opening parenthesis on a new line, then your content, finally a closing parenthesis on its own line. For more information, read about <a href="Scripts.htm#continuation">Continuation Sections</a>.</p>
<pre>Send "
(
Line 1
Line 2
Apples are a fruit.
)"</pre>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There are several different forms of Send. Each has their own special features. If one form of Send does not work for your needs, try another type of Send. Simply replace the function name "Send" with one of the following: SendText, SendInput, SendPlay, SendEvent. For more information on what each one does, <a href="commands/Send.htm">read this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="s31">a. Games </h3>
<p class="warning"><strong>This is important:</strong> A lot of games, especially modern ones, have cheat prevention software. Things like GameGuard, Hackshield, PunkBuster and several others. Not only is bypassing these systems in violation of the games policies and could get you banned, they are complex to work around.</p>
<p>If a game has a cheat prevention system and your hotkeys, hotstrings and Send functions do not work, you are out of luck. However there are methods that can increase the chance of working in some games, but there is no magical <i>"make it work in my game now!!!"</i> button. So try <b>ALL</b> of these before giving up.</p>

<p>There are also known issues with DirectX. If you are having issues and you know the game uses DirectX, try the stuff described on the <a href="FAQ.htm#games">FAQ</a> page. More DirectX issues may occur when using <a href="commands/PixelSearch.htm">PixelSearch</a>, <a href="commands/PixelGetColor.htm">PixelGetColor</a> or <a href="commands/ImageSearch.htm">ImageSearch</a>. Colors might turn out black (0x000000) no matter the color you try to get. You should also try running the game in windowed mode, if possible. That fixes some DirectX issues.</p>
<p>There is no single solution to make AutoHotkey work in all programs. If everything you try fails, it may not be possible to use AutoHotkey for your needs.</p>

<h2 id="s4">4 - Running Programs &amp; Websites</h2>
To run a program such as <i>mspaint.exe, calc.exe, script.ahk</i> or even a folder, you can use the <a href="commands/Run.htm">Run</a> function. It can even be used to open URLs such as <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">https://www.autohotkey.com/</a> . If your computer is setup to run the type of program you want to run, it's very simple:
<pre><em>; Run a program. Note that most programs will require a FULL file path:</em>
Run A_ProgramFiles "\Some_Program\Program.exe"

<em>; Run a website:</em>
Run "https://www.autohotkey.com"</pre>
<p>There are some other advanced features as well, such as command line parameters and CLSID. If you want to learn more about that stuff, visit the <a href="commands/Run.htm">Run</a> page. </p>
<p>Here are a few more samples:</p>
<pre><em>; Several programs do not need a full path, such as Windows-standard programs:</em>
Run "notepad.exe"
Run "mspaint.exe"

<em>; Run the "My Documents" folder using a <a href="Variables.htm#BuiltIn">built-in variable</a>:</em>
Run A_MyDocuments

<em>; Run some websites:</em>
Run "https://www.autohotkey.com"
Run "https://www.google.com"</pre>

<h2 id="s5">5 - Function Calls with or without Parentheses</h2>
<p>In AutoHotkey, function calls can be specified with or without parentheses. The parentheses are usually only necessary if the return value of the function is needed or the function name is not written at the start of the line.</p>
<p class="note">A list of all built-in functions can be found <a href="commands/index.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>A typical function call looks like this:</p>
<pre>Function(Parameter1, Parameter2, Parameter3) <em>; with parentheses</em>
Function Parameter1, Parameter2, Parameter3  <em>; without parentheses</em></pre>
<p>The parameters support any kind of expression; this means for example:</p>
<ol>
    <li>You can do math in them:
        <pre>SubStr(37 * 12, 1, 2)
SubStr(A_Hour - 12, 2)</pre>
    </li>
    <li>You can call another functions inside them (note that these function calls must be specified with parentheses as they are not at the start of the line):
        <pre>SubStr(A_AhkPath, InStr(A_AhkPath, "AutoHotkey"))</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Text needs to be wrapped in quotes:
        <pre>SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)</pre>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>The most common way assigning the return value of a function to a variable is like so:</p>
<pre><span style="color:#ff4400"><b>MyVar</b></span> := SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)</pre>
<p class="note">This isn't the only way, but the most common. You are using <code>MyVar</code> to store the return value of the function that is to the right of the <code>:=</code> operator. See <a href="Functions.htm">Functions</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<pre><em>; These are function calls without parentheses:</em>
MsgBox "This is some text."
StrReplace Input, "AutoHotKey", "AutoHotkey"
SendInput "This is awesome{!}{!}{!}"

<em>; These are function calls with parentheses:</em>
SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)
FileExist(VariableContainingPath)
Output := SubStr("I'm scripting, awesome!", 16)</pre>

<h3 id="s51">a. Code blocks</h3>
<p><a href="commands/Block.htm">Code blocks</a> are lines of code surrounded by little curly brackets (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>). They group a section of code together so that AutoHotkey knows it's one big family and that it needs to stay together. They are most often used with functions and control flow statements such as <a href="commands/If.htm">If</a> and <a href="commands/Loop.htm">Loop</a>. Without them, only the first line in the block is called.</p>
<p>In the following code, both lines are run only if <em>MyVar</em> equals 5:</p>
<pre>if (MyVar = 5)
{
    MsgBox "MyVar equals " MyVar "!!"
    ExitApp
}</pre>
<p>In the following code, the message box is only shown if <em>MyVar</em> equals 5. The script will always exit, even if <em>MyVar</em> <b>is not</b> 5:</p>
<pre>if (MyVar = 5)
    MsgBox "MyVar equals " MyVar "!!"
    ExitApp</pre>
<p>This is perfectly fine since the if-statement only had one line of code associated with it. It's exactly the same as above, but I outdented the second line so we know it's separated from the if-statement:</p>
<pre>if (MyVar = 5)
    MsgBox "MyVar equals " MyVar "!!"
MsgBox "We are now 'outside' of the if-statement. We did not need curly brackets since there was only one line below it."</pre>

<h2 id="s6">6 - Variables</h2>
<p><a href="Variables.htm">Variables</a> are like little post-it notes that hold some information. They can be used to store text, numbers, data from functions or even mathematical equations. Without them, programming and scripting would be much more tedious.</p>
<p>Variables can be assigned a few ways. We'll cover the most common forms. Please pay attention to the colon equal sign (<code>:=</code>).</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Text assignment</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyVar := "Text"</pre>
        <p>This is the simplest form for a variable. Simply type in your text and done. Any text needs to be in quotes.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Variable assignment</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyVar := MyVar2</pre>
        <p>Same as above, but you are assigning a value of a variable to another variable.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Number assignment</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyVar := 6 + 8 / 3 * 2 - Sqrt(9)</pre>
        <p>Thanks to expressions, you can do math!</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Mixed assignment</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyVar := "The value of 5 + " MyVar2 " is: " 5 + MyVar2</pre>
        <p>A combination of the three assignments above.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
<p class="note">Equal signs (<b>=</b>) with a symbol in front of it such as <code>:=</code> <code>+=</code> <code>-=</code> <code>.=</code> etc. are called <b>assignment operators</b> and always require an expression.</p>

<h3 id="s62">a. Getting user input</h3>
<p>Sometimes you want to have the user to choose the value of stuff. There are several ways of doing this, but the simplest way is <a href="commands/InputBox.htm">InputBox</a>. Here is a simple example on how to ask the user a couple of questions and doing some stuff with what was entered:</p>
<pre>OutputVar := InputBox("What is your first name?", "Question 1").Value
if (OutputVar = "Bill")
    MsgBox "That's an awesome name, " OutputVar "."

OutputVar2 := InputBox("Do you like AutoHotkey?", "Question 2").Value
if (OutputVar2 = "yes")
    MsgBox "Thank you for answering " OutputVar2 ", " OutputVar "! We will become great friends."
else
    MsgBox OutputVar ", That makes me sad."</pre>

<h3 id="s63">b. Other Examples?</h3>
<pre class="NoIndent">Result := <a href="commands/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>("Would you like to continue?",, 4)
if <a href="commands/MsgBox.htm#Result">Result</a> = "No"
    return  <em>; If No, stop the code from going further.</em>
MsgBox "You pressed YES."  <em>; Otherwise, the user picked yes.</em></pre>
<pre class="NoIndent">Var := "text"  <em>; Assign some text to a variable.</em>
Num := 6  <em>; Assign a number to a variable.</em>
Var2 := Var  <em>; Assign a variable to another.</em>
Var3 .= Var  <em>; Append a variable to the end of another.</em>
Var4 += Num  <em>; Add the value of a variable to another.</em>
Var4 -= Num  <em>; Subtract the value of a variable from another.</em>
Var5 := SubStr(Var, 2, 2)  <em>; Variable inside a function.</em>
Var6 := Var "Text"  <em>; Assigns a variable to another with some extra text.</em>
MsgBox(Var)  <em>; Variable inside a function.</em>
MsgBox Var  <em>; Same as above.</em>
Var := StrSplit(Var, "x")  <em>; Variable inside a function that uses InputVar and OutputVar.</em>
if (Num = 6)  <em>; Check if a variable is equal to a number.</em>
if Num = 6  <em>; Same as above.</em>
if (Var != Num)  <em>; Check if a variable is not equal to another.</em>
if Var1 &lt; Var2  <em>; Check if a variable is lesser than another.</em></pre>
<h2 id="s7">7 - Objects</h2>
<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This section about objects is outdated. For more up-to-date information, see <a href="Objects.htm">Objects</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Objects.htm">Objects</a> are a way of organizing your data for more efficient usage. Sometimes objects are referred to as arrays, but it's important to note that all arrays are just objects. We call objects different things depending on what we are using them for, but all objects are the same.</p>
<p>An object is basically a collection of variables. The variable names are known as "Keys", and the contents of the variables are "Values".</p>
<p>When you hear people calling an object an <i>array</i> or <i>indexed array</i>, it usually means that all the keys are sequential numbers 1 and up. When you hear people calling an object an <i>associative array</i>, it means that the keys are either strings (text) or non-sequential numbers. Sometimes it's a mix of both, and sequential numbers too!</p>
<p>There are no restrictions to what a key or value can be, and they can even be other arrays! When the values are arrays too, this is referred to as a <i>nested array</i>, and these will be explained later.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons you might want to use an object for something. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You want to have a numbered list of things, such as a grocery list (this would be referred to as an indexed array)</li>
    <li>You want to represent a grid, perhaps for a board game (this would be done with nested objects)</li>
    <li>You have a list of things where each thing has a name, such as the characteristics of a fruit (this would be referred to as an associative array)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s71">a. Creating Objects</h3>
<p>There are a few ways to create an object, and the most common ones are listed below:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Bracket syntax</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyObject := ["one", "two", "three", 17]</pre>
        <p>This will start you off with what is sometimes called an "indexed array". An indexed array is an object representing a list of items, numbered 1 and up. In this example, the value <code>"one"</code> is stored in object key <code>1</code> (aka index 1), and the value <code>17</code> is stored in object key <code>4</code> (aka index 4).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Brace syntax</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Banana := {"Color": "Yellow", "Taste": "Delicious", "Price": 3}</pre>
        <p>This will let you start of by defining what is sometimes called an "associative array". An associative array is a collection of data where each item has a name. In this example, the value <code>"Yellow"</code> is stored in the object key <code>"Color"</code>. Also, the value <code>3</code> is stored in the object key <code>"Price"</code>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Array constructor</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyObject := Array("one", "two", "three", 17)</pre>
        <p>This is equivalent to the bracket syntax. It is actually calling the Array class, not a function.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Other constructor</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Banana := Fruit()</pre>
        <p>Creates an object of the given class (Fruit in this case).</p>
    </dd>
</dl>
<p>It's important to remember that every one of these definitions all create the same thing (objects), just with different keys.</p>

<h3 id="s72">b. Using Objects</h3>
<p>There are many ways to use objects, including retrieving values, setting values, adding more values, and more.</p>

<h4 id="To_set_values">To set values:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Bracket notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Banana["Pickled"] := True <em>; This banana has been pickled. Eww.</em></pre>
        <p>Setting values in an object is as simple as setting the value of a variable. All you have to do is put your bracket notation on the left side of an expression assignment operator <code>:=</code>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Dot notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Banana.Consistency := "Mushy"</pre>
        <p>The same as above but with the dot notation.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="To_retrieve_values">To retrieve values:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Bracket notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Value := Banana["Color"]</pre>
        <p>This allows you to use an expression as the key to get the value from your object. In this case, I used the simple expression <code>"Color"</code>, which is (unsurprisingly) the key <code>Color</code>. You will get a message box with the word "Yellow", because that is what we set the key <code>Color</code> to in the <a href="#s71">previous section</a>.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Dot notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Value := Banana.Color</pre>
        <p>This only lets you use literal strings for the keys. You cannot use variables in your keys with dot notation.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="To_add_new_keys_and_values">To add new keys and values:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Bracket notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyObject["NewerKey"] := 3.1415</pre>
        <p>To directly add a key and value, just set a key that doesn't exist yet.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Dot notation</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyObject.NewKey := "Shiny"</pre>
        <p>The same as above but with the dot notation.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>InsertAt method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyObject.InsertAt(Index, Value1, Value2, Value3...)</pre>
        <p><i>Index</i> is any integer key. This will shift ALL higher integer keys up by the number of values which were inserted, even if there are gaps (for example, only keys 1 and 100 exist, and you insert a value at key 50, it will shift 100 up to 101).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Push method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyObject.Push(Value1, Value2, Value3...)</pre>
        <p>This "appends" the values to the end of the array <i>MyObject</i>. In other words, it inserts the values at the highest integer key plus one.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="To_remove_keys_and_values">To remove keys and values:</h4>
<dl>
    <dt>Blanking the value out</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">Banana.Consistency := ""</pre>
        <p>The simplest way to remove a value is to just blank it out. You can do this by setting it to <code>""</code>, also known as an <i>empty string</i>. This doesn't remove the key, but it will make the value appear identical to an unset value. It is possible to tell that the key still exists by using the <a href="objects/Object.htm#HasKey">HasKey</a> method, and it will still come up in a <a href="commands/For.htm">For</a> loop.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Delete method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">RemovedValue := MyObject.Delete(AnyKey)</pre>
        <p>This and the next methods below remove the key <i>and</i> the value. The previous value of <code>MyObject[AnyKey]</code> will be stored in <i>RemovedValue</i>.</p>
        <pre class="NoIndent">NumberOfRemovedKeys := MyObject.Delete(FirstKey, LastKey)</pre>
        <p>Allows you to remove a range of numbered/integer or string keys between <em>FirstKey</em> and <em>LastKey</em>. The value it gives will be the number of keys that were removed, which is useful if you have a gap between your keys (e.g. you specify keys 1 through four, but key number 2 doesn't exist, this will set <em>NumberOfRemovedKeys</em> to 3 as only three keys were there to be removed).</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Pop method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">MyObject.Pop()</pre>
        <p>This removes the highest integer key, and returns the value. There are no keys higher than it to be affected.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>RemoveAt method</dt>
    <dd>
        <pre class="NoIndent">RemovedValue := MyObject.RemoveAt(Index)</pre>
        <pre class="NoIndent">NumberOfRemovedKeys := MyObject.RemoveAt(Index, Length)</pre>
        <p>This removes all keys from <i>Index</i> to <i>Index + Length - 1</i> (inclusive). If <i>Length</i> is omitted it defaults to 1. After removing the keys it takes all higher numbered/integer keys and moves them down to fill the gap, so that if there was a value at <i>Index + Length</i> it will now be at <i>Index</i>. This is similar to how the InsertAt method with multiple specified values works.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="s8">8 - Other Helpful Goodies</h2>
<p>We have reached the end of our journey, my good friend. I hope you have learned something. But before we go, here are some other things that I think you should know. Enjoy!</p>

<h3 id="s81">a. The mysterious square brackets</h3>
<p>Throughout the documentation, you will see these two symbols (<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>) surrounding code in the yellow syntax box at the top of almost all pages. Anything inside of these brackets are <b><i>OPTIONAL</i></b>. Meaning the stuff inside can be left out if you don't need them. When writing your code, it is very important to <b>NOT</b> type the square brackets in your code.</p>
<p>On the <a href="commands/ControlGetText.htm">ControlGetText</a> page you will see this:</p>
<pre class="Syntax">Text := <span class="func">ControlGetText</span>(Control <span class="optional">, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span>)</pre>
<p>So you could simply do this if you wanted:</p>
<pre>Text := ControlGetText(Control)</pre>
<p>Or add in some more details:</p>
<pre>Text := ControlGetText(Control, WinTitle)</pre>
<p>What if you wanted to use <em>ExcludeTitle</em> but not fill in <em>WinText</em> or <em>WinTitle</em>? Simple!</p>
<pre>Text := ControlGetText(Control,,, ExcludeTitle)</pre>
<p>Please note that you cannot IGNORE parameters, but you can leave them blank. If you were to ignore <code>WinTitle, WinText</code>, it would look like this and cause issues:</p>
<pre>Text := ControlGetText(Control, ExcludeTitle)</pre>

<h3 id="s82">b. Finding your AHK version</h3>
<p>Run this code to see your AHK version:</p>
<pre>MsgBox A_AhkVersion</pre>
<p>Or look for "AutoHotkey Help File" or "AutoHotkey.chm" in the start menu or your installation directory.</p>

<h3 id="s83">c. Trial and Error</h3>
<p>Trial and Error is a very common and effective way of learning. Instead of asking for help on every little thing, sometimes spending some time alone (sometimes hours or days) and trying to get something to work will help you learn faster.</p>
<p>If you try something and it gives you an error, study that error. Then try to fix your code. Then try running it again. If you still get an error, modify your code some more. Keep trying and failing until your code fails no more. You will learn a lot this way by reading the documentation, reading errors and learning what works and what doesn't. Try, fail, try, fail, try, try, try, fail, fail, <b>succeed!</b></p>
<p>This is how a lot of "pros" have learned. But don't be afraid to ask for help, we don't bite (hard). Learning takes time, the "pros" you encounter did not learn to be masters in just a few hours or days.</p>
<p class="note">"If at first you don't succeed, try, try, try again." - Hickson, William E.</p>
<h3 id="s84">d. Indentation</h3>
<p>This stuff (indentation) is very important! Your code will run perfectly fine without it, but it will be a major headache for you and other to read your code. Small code (25 lines or less) will probably be fine to read without indentation, but it'll soon get sloppy. It's best you learn to indent ASAP. Indentation has no set style, but it's best to keep everything consistent.</p>
<p>"<b>What is indentation?</b>" you ask? It's simply spacing to break up your code so you can see what belongs to what. People usually use 3 or 4 spaces or 1 tab per "level".</p>
<p>Not indented:</p>
<pre>if (car = "old")
{
MsgBox "The car is really old."
if (wheels = "flat")
{
MsgBox "This car is not safe to drive."
return
}
else
{
MsgBox "Be careful! This old car will be dangerous to drive."
}
}
else
{
MsgBox "My, what a shiny new vehicle you have there."
}</pre>
<p>Indented:</p>

<pre>if (car = "old")
{
    MsgBox "The car is really old."
    if (wheels = "flat")
    {
        MsgBox "This car is not safe to drive."
        return
    }
    else
    {
        MsgBox "Be careful! This old car will be dangerous to drive."
    }
}
else
{
    MsgBox "My, what a shiny new vehicle you have there."
}</pre>
<p>See Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style">Indentation style</a> page for various styles and examples. Choose what you like or learn to indent how you think it's easiest to read.</p>

<h3 id="s85">e. Asking for Help</h3>
<p>Before you ask, try doing some research yourself or try to code it yourself. If that did not yield results that satisfy you, read below.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Don't be afraid to ask for help, even the smartest people ask others for help.</li>
    <li>Don't be afraid to show what you tried, even if you think it's silly.</li>
    <li>Post anything you have tried.</li>
    <li>Pretend <i>everyone but you</i> is a doorknob and knows nothing. Give as much information as you can to educate us doorknobs at what you are trying to do. Help us help you.</li>
    <li>Be patient.</li>
    <li>Be polite.</li>
    <li>Be open.</li>
    <li>Be kind.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't get an answer right away, wait at least 1 day (24 hours) before asking for more help. We love to help, but we also do this for free on our own time. We might be at work, sleeping, gaming, with family or just too busy to help.</p>
<p>And while you wait for help, you can try learning and doing it yourself. It's a good feeling, making something yourself without help.</p>
