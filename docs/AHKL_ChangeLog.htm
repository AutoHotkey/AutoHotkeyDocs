<h1>Changes &amp; New Features</h1>
<p>Changes and new features introduced by the current branch of AutoHotkey development (a.k.a. AutoHotkey_L) are listed below.</p>
<p>For older changes, see <a href="ChangeLogHelp.htm">Archived Changes</a>.</p>

<!--new revisions go here-->

<p>Fixed <code>break label</code> crashing the program if nested directly inside its target loop.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.23.05">1.1.23.05 - March 27, 2016</h2>
<p>Fixed InputBox, MsgBox, FileSelectFile and FileSelectFolder sending an unwanted Alt-up if Alt is down. This was due to an error with the Ctrl/Shift workaround added in v1.1.22.01.</p>
<p>Improved the Ctrl/Shift workaround to avoid unnecessarily "masking" the Win key if Ctrl, Shift or Alt is also down.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.23.04">1.1.23.04 - March 26, 2016</h2>
<p>Fixed LV_Modify to support omitting Options, as in <code>LV_Modify(r,, col1)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.23.03">1.1.23.03 - March 12, 2016</h2>
<p>Fixed __Delete meta-functions erroneously suppressing or prematurely re-throwing exceptions, when they are called during exception propagation.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.22.00">1.1.22.00 - May 1, 2015</h2>
<p>Added SetErrorMode(SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS) on program startup to suppress system-level error messages such as "There is no disk in the drive". Calling Drive or DriveGet no longer affects the process' error mode.</p>
<p>Changed MonthCal controls to have tab-stop by default on Vista or later.</p>

<p>Added <a href="commands/LoopFile.htm">Loop, Files, FilePattern [, Mode]</a>.</p>
<p>Changed <em>InputVar</em> parameters to allow <a href="Variables.htm#percent-space">% expression</a> (except with If commands).</p>
<p>Revised <a href="objects/Object.htm">Object methods</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added Object.InsertAt(), Object.Push() and ObjRawSet().</li>
  <li>Added Object.Delete(), Object.RemoveAt() and Object.Pop().</li>
  <li>Added Object.Length().</li>
</ul>

<p>Removed the obsolete and undocumented 5-parameter mode of RegRead, which was exclusively for AutoIt v2 compatibility (the extra parameter was unused).</p>
<p>Changed <a href="commands/RegRead.htm">RegRead</a>, <a href="commands/RegWrite.htm">RegWrite</a> and <a href="commands/RegDelete.htm">RegDelete</a> so that the RootKey and SubKey parameters can optionally be combined.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.20.03">1.1.20.03 - March 21, 2015</h2>
<p>Fixed MouseGetPos (OutputVarControl), GuiContextMenu and GuiDropFiles (A_GuiControl) to not ignore disabled controls [broken by v1.1.20.00].</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.20.02">1.1.20.02 - March 11, 2015</h2>
<p>Fixed add-first mode of OnMessage.</p>
<p>Fixed A_OSVersion for unrecognized OSes on x64 builds.</p>
<p>Fixed ExitApp to unpause the script before releasing objects in case a __delete meta-function is called.</p>
<p>Trivial optimizations and code maintenance.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.20.01">1.1.20.01 - March 10, 2015</h2>
<p>Reverted the changes made in v1.1.20.00 to saving and restoring of ErrorLevel on thread interrupt, due to unintended consequences.</p>
<ul>
  <li>ErrorLevel is not reset or cleared when a new thread starts. Instead, it retains the value it had in the interrupted thread, as in v1.1.19 and older.</li>
  <li>If ErrorLevel contains an object and the thread is interrupted, the object is replaced with an empty string when the thread resumes, as in v1.1.19 and older.</li>
  <li>If ErrorLevel contains a string longer than 127 characters, it is truncated when the thread resumes, as in v1.1.19 and older.</li>
</ul>
<p>Re-fixed timers sometimes causing ErrorLevel to be formatted as hex.</p>
<p>Fixed class methods to retain a counted reference to the class.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.20.00">1.1.20.00 - March 8, 2015</h2>
<h4>New features:</h4>
<p>Enhanced Hotkey, Menu, SetTimer, Gui events and Gui control events to accept <a href="misc/Labels.htm#Functions">a function instead of a label</a>, if no label is found.</p>
<p>Enhanced Hotkey, Menu, SetTimer and Gui control events to accept a <a href="objects/Functor.htm">function object</a>. Added a Delete sub-command for SetTimer to allow the object to be released.</p>
<p>Enhanced <a href="commands/OnMessage.htm">OnMessage()</a> to allow any number of functions or function objects to monitor a single message.</p>
<p>Added <a href="commands/OnExit.htm">OnExit()</a> and <a href="commands/OnClipboardChange.htm">OnClipboardChange()</a>, which accept a function name or object.</p>
<p>Added capability to <a href="Hotkeys.htm#Function">point hotkey labels at a function definition</a>.</p>
<p>Added <a href="commands/Format.htm#ULT">U/L/T modifiers</a> to perform case conversion with Format().</p>
<p>Added the <a href="commands/Input.htm#E">E option</a> to the Input command, for handling end keys by character instead of keycode.</p>
<p>Added ** (stderr) support to FileAppend.</p>
<p>Added <a href="commands/ObjBindMethod.htm">ObjBindMethod(obj, method, args*)</a> and <a href="objects/Func.htm#Bind">Func.Bind(args*)</a>.</p>

<h4>Changes:</h4>
<p>Changed the default behavior when the main script file is not found:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If no script was specified and the default script files are not found, show the new <a href="Welcome.htm">Welcome</a> page in the help file.</li>
  <li>If a script was specified or the help file is missing (or is named differently to the executable), just show an error message.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changed WinActivate to restore the window if already active but minimized.</p>
<p>Changed WinActivate to look for a visible window to activate if DetectHiddenWindows is off and the active window is hidden, instead of doing nothing.</p>
<p>Changed the method used by A_CaretX/A_CaretY to retrieve the caret position.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Returns blank in more cases where the real caret position can't be determined, instead of returning the top-left of the active window.</li>
  <li>Less likely to cause side-effects.</li>
  <li>Works in console windows.</li>  
</ul>
<p>Changed A_OSVersion to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff561910">RtlGetVersion()</a>, so that it can detect Windows 10 and hopefully future versions.</p>
<p>Changed A_OSVersion to return a version number of the form "major.minor.build" if it doesn't have a name for the OS.</p>
<p>Changed objects to support <code>x[,y]</code>, <code>x.y[,z]</code> and <code>x[](y)</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>User-defined objects can utilize this by specifying default values for parameters of properties and meta-functions.  For __Call, the first parameter is omitted, as in <code>x.__Call(,y)</code>.</li>
  <li>COM objects invoke DISPID_VALUE if the member name is omitted. For example, <code>x[]</code> retrieves x's default property and <code>fn[]()</code> can be used to call JScript functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several under-the-hood changes to fix bugs, reduce code size or improve performance, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes to preparsing of #if and static var initializers.</li>
  <li>Changes to preparsing of { blocks }.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bug-fixes:</h4>
<p>Fixed VK to keyname conversions for keys 'A' to 'Z' to respect layout.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Applies to: GetKeyName, Hotkey control, A_PriorKey, KeyHistory and Input EndKey ErrorLevel (except where Shift key is required).</li>
  <li>All other keys, including those that produce non-ASCII letters, were already translated according to AutoHotkey's current keyboard layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed FileAppend to * (stdout) to respect the encoding parameter instead of always outputting ANSI text.</p>
<p>Fixed auto-sizing of GUIs with only one scrollbar.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>Exception(m, n)</code> crashing when n is too far out of bounds.</p>
<p>Fixed GuiContextMenu to set A_GuiEvent correctly on x64.</p>
<p>Fixed FileGetSize sometimes giving an indeterminate result if the file doesn't exist or can't be opened.</p>
<p>Fixed thread interrupts to save and restore ErrorLevel more fully [reverted in v1.1.20.01 due to unintended consequences].</p>
<p>Fixed ControlClick Pos mode to ignore disabled controls.</p>
<p>Fixed odd behaviour when Gui +MaxSize is smaller than +MinSize.</p>
<p>Fixed GuiControl/Get requiring a Gui name when given a control HWND.</p>
<p>Fixed meta-functions interfering with the line number reported by Exception().</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.19.03">1.1.19.03 - February 11, 2015</h2>
<p>Improved remapping to allow <code>scXXX::Y</code> when the current keyboard layout does not map <code>scXXX</code> to a VK code. However, <code>Y</code> must still exist on the current keyboard layout.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>break n</code> to work correctly when <code>until</code> is present, instead of terminating the thread.</p>
<p>Fixed ControlGetFocus disrupting the user's ability to double-click (thanks HotKeyIt).</p>
<p>Fixed ListView to not call the control's g-label for unsupported (and previously unknown) notifications such as LVN_GETEMPTYMARKUP.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>#Include *i &lt;X&gt;</code> to exit the program as intended if X has a syntax error.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>for var in <i>expression</i></code> sometimes crashing the program when <i>expression</i> calls a script function.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.19.02">1.1.19.02 - January 25, 2015</h2>
<p>Removed the 16-color icons which were used on Win9x/Win2k.</p>
<p>Removed the separate tray icon resources.</p>
<p>Improved selection of icon size when loading icons from DLL/EXE files.</p>
<ul><li>In short, prefer to downscale rather than upscale. This is especially helpful on systems with 125% or 150% DPI, where the system icon sizes are 20/40 or 24/48 instead of 16/32. If all of these sizes are present in the icon resource, this change makes no difference.</li></ul>
<p>Fixed some issues with hotkey validation at load time.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hotkeys which are never valid, like foo::, are now always treated as errors instead of giving a misleading warning about keyboard layout.</li>
	<li>Hotkeys like ^!&auml;:: which are inactive because of the current keyboard layout are now allowed to have a same-line action, and the label is registered correctly (e.g. as "^!&auml;" and not as "^!&auml;:"). If the /iLib command line switch is used, the warning is suppressed.</li>
	<li>Remappings which are inactive because of the current keyboard layout now show two warnings instead of an unrecoverable error.</li>
	<li>If a Wheel hotkey is used as a prefix key, there is only one error message instead of two, and it respects /ErrorStdOut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed /iLib switch to write the file even if there's a syntax error.</p>
<p>Fixed return/break/continue/goto in try..<a href="commands/Finally.htm">finally</a>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.19.01">1.1.19.01 - January 5, 2015</h2>
<p>Fixed Hotkey command crashing the program when trying to create new variants of existing hotkeys (broken by v1.1.19.00).</p>
<p>Made some minor optimizations to the Hotkey command and A_TimeIdle, relating to removal of Win9x support.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.19.00">1.1.19.00 - January 4, 2015</h2>
<p>Added a name for <code>Func.Call()</code>. <code>Func.()</code> still works but is deprecated.</p>
<p>Fixed some issues with <code>X.Y</code> and <code>X.Y(Z)</code> in VBScript/JScript/C#:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If <code>X.__Call</code> contained a function <em>name</em>, it was being returned instead of called.</li>
  <li>When <code>X.Y(Z)</code> returned a value, Z was ignored. Now it acts like <code>X.Y[Z]</code> when X.Y is not a function.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed the Hotkey command ignoring the ~ (pass-through) prefix if <em>Label</em> was omitted.</p>
<p>Fixed the Hotkey command ignoring the $ (use-hook) prefix if the hotkey variant was already created without $.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>%Fn%()</code> syntax to work with JavaScript Function objects.</p>
<p>Fixed EXE manifest to disable UAC installer detection heuristics (broken by v1.1.17).</p>
<p>Improved the way threads are represented on the debugger's call stack.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The type of thread is shown instead of the label name, which is still available in the next stack entry.  For hotkeys, the hotkey is shown instead.</li>
  <li>The line number of the sub or function that the thread called is shown instead of the line the script was at before starting the thread.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="v1.1.18.00">1.1.18.00 - December 30, 2014</h2>
<p>Improved IDispatch implementation for AutoHotkey objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>X.Y</code> in VBScript and C# now returns X.Y if it is NOT a Func object; previously, it attempted to call X.Y() regardless of type.</li>
  <li><code>X(Y)</code> in VBScript, JScript and C# now returns X[Y] unless X is a Func object, in which case it is called as before.</li>
  <li><code>X[Y]</code> in C# now returns X[Y] if X is NOT a Func object; previously, it attempted to call X[Y]() regardless of type.</li>
  <li><code>X.Y()</code> in C# now returns X.Y if it is NOT a Func object, due to ambiguity in the C# dispatch implementation.</li>
  <li>Unhandled exceptions are now converted to IDispatch exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Added support for creating new properties in JavaScript/IE DOM objects.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>FileAppend, %VarContainingClipboardAll%, File</code> causing crashes.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.17.01">1.1.17.01 - December 28, 2014</h2>
<p>Fixed COM event handlers not receiving the final object parameter.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.17.00">1.1.17.00 - December 27, 2014</h2>
<h4>New features:</h4>
<p>Added <a href="commands/Format.htm">Format()</a>.</p>
<p><a href="commands/FileOpen.htm">FileOpen()</a> can now be used to read from stdin or write to stdout or stderr by passing <code>"*"</code> or <code>"**"</code> as the filename. <code>AutoHotkey.exe *</code> can be used to execute script text piped from another process instead of read from file. For an example, see <a href="commands/Run.htm#ExecScript">ExecScript()</a>.</p>
<p>Added support for passing AutoHotkey objects to COM APIs as IDispatch.</p>
<p>Added support for VT_BYREF in ComObject wrappers. Use <code>obj[]</code> to access the referenced value.</p>
<h4>Bug-fixes:</h4>
<p>Fixed blue-screening on XP SP2.</p>
<p>Fixed owned ComObjArrays to be returned by value, not by pointer. That is, a copy of the array is returned instead of a pointer to an array which is about to be deleted.</p>
<p>Changed the URL in the sample script which is created when you first run AutoHotkey.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>sc15D</code> to map to <code>vk5D</code>/AppsKey (Send, GetKeyName, etc.).</p>
<p>Fixed Edit controls to not treat AltGr+A as Ctrl+A.</p>
<p>Fixed static class vars to not act as a target for labels which immediately precede the class.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.16.05">1.1.16.05 - September 28, 2014</h2>
<p>Fixed x.y/[]/{} sometimes falsely being flagged as variadic.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.16.04">1.1.16.04 - September 16, 2014</h2>
<p>Fixed a crash which occurred when overwriting a non-writable property.</p>
<p>Fixed a crash which occurred when a RegExMatch object is created with uncaptured subpatterns during a regex callout.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.16.03">1.1.16.03 - September 11, 2014</h2>
<p>Fixed some bad behaviour in Abs() and Mod() caused by a broken bug-fix in v1.1.16.01.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.16.02">1.1.16.02 - September 11, 2014</h2>
<p>Fixed parser to allow #include inside a class (broken by a6ea27f).</p>
<p>Fixed Clipboard returning binary CF_HDROP data in some instances.</p>
<p>Improved accuracy of FileGetSize on files which are still open.</p>
<p>Improved for-loop compatibility with COM objects.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.16.01">1.1.16.01 - September 10, 2014</h2>
<p>Added syntax for defining dynamic <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_property">properties</a> in classes.</p>
<p>Added x+m and y+m options for Gui control positioning.</p>
<p>Added the #InputLevel of each hotkey to ListHotkeys (when non-zero).</p>
<p>Optimized RegExMatch with the O (object) option; capturing part of a long string is much faster than before in some cases.</p>
<p>Fixed objects to check for new methods after __Call completes (consistent with __Set and __Get).</p>
<p>Fixed some undefined behaviour occurring after VarSetCapacity fails.</p>
<p>Fixed FileRead to correctly report an error with files over 4GB, instead of truncating even when it wasn't requested.</p>
<p>Fixed FileRead *c to null-terminate correctly when byte length is odd.</p>
<p>Fixed some ClipboardAll issues and changed behaviour:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="commands/_ClipboardTimeout.htm">#ClipboardTimeout</a> is ignored for GetClipboardData(), since it never actually worked and it caused problems. This fixes timeouts and lost data when a file is on the clipboard (any file on Windows 8, or any file in a zip file or similar).</li>
  <li>Zero-length clipboard items are allocated 1 byte upon restoring to the clipboard, since setting a zero-length item seems to always fail.</li>
  <li>The presence of MSDEVColumnSelect/MSDEVLineSelect is now preserved when set by Scintilla, though any data set by VS is discarded.</li>
  <li>When writing ClipboardAll directly to file, it now prefers Unicode (other usages of ClipboardAll have had this behaviour since v1.1.08).</li>
  <li>ClipboardAll and FileRead *c on Unicode builds now round length up when odd. This increases the reported StrLen by 1, potentially avoiding truncation of the last byte.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixed a possible ListView/TreeView message filtering issue.</p>
<p>Fixed A_LineFile/A_LineNumber in #If expressions.</p>

<p>Fixed <code>Abs(["-"]*)</code> and similar crashing the program.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>} funcdef(){</code> globally and <code>}}</code> ending a method/property/class.</p>
<h2 id="v1.1.15.04">1.1.15.04 - August 12, 2014</h2>
<p>Fixed a performance issue with <code>&amp;var_containing_long_string_of_digits</code>.</p>

<p>Fixed parser to disallow <code>continue</code> where appropriate even if the current function is defined inside a Loop.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>File.Encoding := x "-RAW"</code> breaking encoding/decoding of non-ASCII characters. The <code>-RAW</code> suffix is now ignored.</p>

<p>Added A_OSVersion value <code>WIN_8.1</code>.</p>
<p>Changed the Hotkey command to apply/remove passthrough behavior on existing hotkey variants depending on whether the <a href="Hotkeys.htm#Tilde">tilde (~) prefix</a> is present.</p>
<p>Changed exe manifest to allow <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724439">GetVersion</a>/<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724451">GetVersionEx</a> to detect Windows 8.1.</p>

<p>Fixed breakpoints shifting onto class var initializers when they are interspersed with method definitions.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.14.02">1.1.14.02 - January 30, 2014</h2>
<p>Fixed <code>x::</code> and <code>x up::</code> both firing on key-up if the state of the modifier keys prevented x from firing on key-down.  The intended behaviour as of v1.1.14 is for both hotkeys to fire on key-up if x is also used in a custom combination like <code>x &amp; y::</code>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.14.01">1.1.14.01 - January 15, 2014</h2>
<p>Fixed Try without Catch/Finally crashing if no exception was thrown.</p>

<p><b>Changed behaviour</b> of <a href="Hotkeys.htm#Tilde">~ prefix</a> with custom combos to be more intuitive.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>x &amp; y::</code> to fire both <code>x::</code> and <code>x up::</code> when x is released.</p>
<p>Fixed ImageSearch to set ErrorLevel=2, not 0, when a GDI call fails.</p>
<p>Fixed EnvGet crashing the program when the var exceeds 32767 chars.</p>
<p>Fixed a minor error-handling bug with StatusBarWait's ErrorLevel.</p>

<p>Fixed variadic function calls with named values for required parameters.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.13.00">1.1.13.00 - August 27, 2013</h2>
<p>Ported <a href="commands/StringSplit.htm">StrSplit()</a> from v2 alpha.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.12.00">1.1.12.00 - August 14, 2013</h2>
<p>Optional parameters can be omitted by writing two consecutive commas, as in <code>InStr(a, b,, 2)</code>.  Unlike previous versions, this now works for objects (including COM objects) and built-in functions.  <code>[a,,b]</code> can be used to create a sparse array.</p>
<p>Object properties can now be set using variadic syntax, as in <code>x[y*]:=z</code>, where y contains an array of keys/indices or parameters.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.11.02">1.1.11.02 - July 28, 2013</h2>
<p>Fixed GuiControl/Get to accept the ClassNN of a ComboBox's child Edit.  Specifying the HWND of a ComboBox's child Edit was already supported as a means of identifying the ComboBox.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.11.01">1.1.11.01 - June 25, 2013</h2>
<p>Fixed InputBox default width/height (broken by v1.1.11.00 - commit <a href="https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/commit/7373cc6443">7373cc6443</a>).</p>
<p>Fixed DllCall arg type validation to handle SYM_OBJECT safely, and to respect #Warn UseUnset (when var name is not a valid type).</p>
<p>Changed VarSetCapacity(var) to never warn about uninitialized vars.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.11.00">1.1.11.00 - June 21, 2013</h2>
<p>Added support for <code>%A_LineFile%</code> in <a href="commands/_Include.htm">#Include</a>.</p>
<p>Reduced the file size of AutoHotkeySC.bin by reducing the resolution of the (rarely used) filetype icon.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>class X extends Y</code> to allow Y to be defined after X.</p>
<p>Developed by fincs: AutoHotkey is now DPI-aware. The Gui commands automatically compensate when DPI is not 96. See <a href="commands/Gui.htm#DPIScale">Gui -DPIScale</a>.</p>
<h2 id="v1.1.10.01">1.1.10.01 - May 17, 2013</h2>

<h2 id="v1.1.09.03">1.1.09.03 - February 9, 2013</h2>
<p>Fixed <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/board/index.php?showtopic=89624">two bugs</a> which affected certain assignments where the target variable contains an unflushed binary number but has zero capacity.</p>
<p>Fixed GuiControl and GuiControlGet acting on the wrong control when given a HWND which does not belong to the current Gui. Instead, the condition is treated as an error.</p>
<p>Fixed OnMessage functions to set A_Gui and A_GuiControl correctly when the target Gui is a child window.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.09.02">1.1.09.02 - December 24, 2012</h2>
<p>Fixed MsgBox to show an error message when given invalid Options, instead of silently exiting the thread.</p>

<h4>Breaking changes:</h4>
<p>Removed <a href="misc/AutoIt2Compat.htm">.aut file compatibility</a> and #AllowSameLineComments.</p>
<p>Removed undocumented AutoIt v2 commands.</p>

<h4>Backward-compatible changes:</h4>
<p>Allow optional parameters to be declared with <code>:=</code> instead of <code>=</code>, for consistency with variable declarations and expressions.</p>
<p>Allow non-ASCII characters in unquoted keys (<code>{<b>key</b>: x}</code> and <code>obj.<b>key</b></code>).</p>
<p>Changed name in version info from "AutoHotkey_L" to "AutoHotkey".</p>

<h4>Bug-fixes:</h4>
<p>Fixed instability caused by warning dialogs appearing part-way through evaluation of a command's args.</p>
<p>Fixed PixelSearch Fast mode treating "not found" as an error.</p>
<p>Fixed ahk_exe to allow other ahk_ criteria after it.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>else continue 2</code> and similar requiring braces around the loop.</p>
<p>Fixed RegRead indicating failure after successfully reading binary data.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>File.Length</code> to compensate for or flush any buffered data.</p>
<p>Fixed Gui sizing to account for scrollbars when present.</p>

<h4>Debugger:</h4>
<p>Added support for asynchronous commands.</p>
<p>Improved handling of breakpoints on lines like <code>else foo()</code> or <code>{ bar()</code> so that the debugger will actually break when appropriate.</p>
<p>Optimized code size, fixed several bugs and made the debugger generally more robust.</p>


<h2 id="v1.1.08.01">1.1.08.01 - August 3, 2012</h2>
<p>Debugger: Fixed max_depth being either half the intended limit or unlimited.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.08.00">1.1.08.00 - July 14, 2012</h2>

<h4>Breaking changes:</h4>
<p>Changed the default script codepage to ANSI, as the previous behaviour was a common source of confusion. UTF-8 files must now have a byte order mark (BOM) to be recognized correctly. Notepad adds a BOM to any file saved as UTF-8.</p>
<p>Changed <code>return x</code> to preserve formatting of numeric strings; it is now equivalent to <code>return (x)</code>.</p>
<p>Changed <code>Gui, Name: New</code> to set the new GUI as the default.</p>

<h4>Other changes:</h4>
<p>Changed ClipboardAll to prefer CF_UNICODETEXT over other text formats.</p>
<p>Changed Gui Show to allow floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>Changed A_OSVersion to return WIN_8 on Windows 8.</p>
<p>Changed AutoHotkey.exe file description to include "ANSI/Unicode 32/64-bit".</p>
<p>Changed the parser to allow lines like <code>new MyObject()</code> with no assignment.</p>
<p>Upgraded PCRE to 8.30.</p>
<p>Improved wording of some <a href="commands/_Warn.htm">warnings</a> and added a pointer to the documentation at the bottom of the warning dialog.</p>
<p>Improvements to the debugger:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added basic support for inspecting Func, ComObject and RegExMatchObject objects.</li>
  <li>Fixed the "attach debugger" message being ignored in some situations. See commit <a href="https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/commit/83f0a0e39a0f69fc8861f8c4234690557c4ab347">83f0a0e</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>New features:</h4>
<p>Added support for the PCRE construct <code>(*MARK:NAME)</code> via <code>RegExMatchObject.Mark</code>.</p>
<p>Added support for <code>classvar.x := y</code> assignments in class definitions (after declaring <em>classvar</em>).</p>
<p>Added <a href="Variables.htm#Is64bitOS">A_Is64bitOS</a>.</p>
<p>Added <a href="commands/SetRegView.htm">SetRegView</a> and <a href="Variables.htm#RegView">A_RegView</a>.</p>

<h4>Fixes:</h4>
<p>Fixed <code>Func.()</code> to merely skip the function call if mandatory parameters were omitted instead of causing the thread to silently exit.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>Object.Remove()</code> not releasing object keys.</p>
<p>Fixed key-down/key-up hotkey pairs to suppress input correctly when only one hotkey in the pair is enabled.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>#Include &lt;Lib&gt;</code> to not affect the working directory used by subsequent #include directives.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>objaddref()</code> acting like <code>ObjRelease()</code> when called with a lower-case 'a'.</p>
<p>Fixed A_AhkPath in 32-bit compiled scripts to detect 64-bit AutoHotkey installations and vice versa.</p>
<p>Fixed TreeView controls with <code>-Background</code> option rendering incorrectly on older OSes.</p>
<p>Fixed error messages shown during execution of While/Until to identify the appropriate line.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.07.03">1.1.07.03 - March 25, 2012</h2>
<p>Fixed Ctrl/Alt/Shift key-down hotkey breaking any corresponding key-up hotkey defined before it.</p>
<p>Fixed key-down hotkeys to always use the hook if defined after a key-up hotkey of the same key. If the key-down hotkey used the "reg" method, the hook would block the key-down event and trigger only the key-up hotkey.</p>
<p>Fixed load-time checks interpreting expressions with no derefs as raw text. For example, <code>gosub % "foo"</code> resolved to <code>"foo":</code> at load-time. Similarly, <code>% ""</code> was seen as invalid in various cases even if an empty string should be allowed.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.07.02">1.1.07.02 - March 22, 2012</h2>
<p>Fixed a rare crash which can occur when GetClipboardData() fails.</p>
<p>Fixed ComObjArray() to return an empty string on failure instead of an arbitrary integer.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>Object.Remove(i, "")</code> affecting integer keys when <code>!Object.HasKey(i)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.07.01">1.1.07.01 - March 2, 2012</h2>
<p>Fixed FileRead to ignore #MaxMem when reading UTF-16 on Unicode builds.</p>
<p>Fixed dynamic function calls with built-in vars such as <code>%A_ThisLabel%()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.07.00">1.1.07.00 - February 27, 2012</h2>
<p>Enhanced <code><a href="Functions.htm#DynCall">%var%()</a></code> to support <a href="objects/Func.htm">function references</a>, <a href="Objects.htm#Objects_as_Functions">objects imitating functions</a> and the <a href="Objects.htm#Default_Base_Object">default __Call meta-function</a>.</p>
<p>Fixed <a href="commands/ControlGet.htm#List">ControlGet List</a> to work for ListViews where the script and the target process aren't both 32-bit or both 64-bit.</p>
<p>Fixed <a href="commands/Send.htm#SendEvent">SendEvent</a> with a key delay of 0; a change introduced by v1.1.05.04 caused it to be slower than intended.</p>
<p>Fixed <a href="objects/Object.htm#Remove">Object.Remove(i)</a> not adjusting keys if Object[i] doesn't exist.</p>
<p>Fixed an error in <a href="commands/ComObjType.htm">ComObjType()</a> which may have caused unpredictable behaviour when it is called via an <a href="commands/ComObjActive.htm#Remarks">alternative name</a>.</p>
<p>Fixed <a href="commands/ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> to exit the thread if an <a href="commands/OnExit.htm">OnExit</a> subroutine prevents the script from terminating, instead of resuming execution after the <a href="commands/Block.htm">block</a> which contained ExitApp.</p>
<p>Calling a function via an object no longer acts as a barrier to exiting the thread. Consequently, if <a href="commands/Exit.htm">Exit</a> is used or a runtime error occurs within a <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_method">class method</a>, the entire thread exits instead of just the function.</p>
<p>Calling a base-class method using <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_base">base.Method()</a> or similar inside a class definition no longer causes a <a href="commands/_Warn.htm">UseUnset</a> warning if the method doesn't exist. Consequently, instantiating an object which has <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes_var">instance variables</a> no longer causes a warning about the internal <code>base.__Init</code> method if the base class has no instance variables.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.06.02">1.1.06.02 - February 13, 2012</h2>
<p>Fixed IniRead crashing when Section is omitted but Key isn't.</p>
<p>Fixed accuracy of FileGetSize with files which are 4GB or larger.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.06.01">1.1.06.01 - February 12, 2012</h2>
<p>Fixed MsgBox smart comma handling to require numeric Options, not Title.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.06.00">1.1.06.00 - February 12, 2012</h2>
<h4>New features:</h4>
<p>Integrated <a href="commands/_InputLevel.htm">#InputLevel</a> directive and <a href="commands/SendLevel.htm">SendLevel</a> command <a href="https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/pull/7">by Russell Davis</a>.</p>
<p>Integrated support for <a href="commands/GuiControls.htm#Link">Link</a> controls <a href="https://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/pull/9">by ChrisS85</a>.</p>
<h4>Breaking changes:</h4>
<p>Changed command parser to avoid trimming escaped characters such as <code>`t</code> or <code>`&nbsp;</code> at the beginning or end of an arg.</p>
<p>Changed <a href="commands/MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>'s smart comma handling to improve flexibility and consistency.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>%</code> can now be used to make Options or Timeout an expression.</li>
  <li>If the first arg is an expression, any unescaped comma which is not
    enclosed in quote marks or parentheses/brackets/braces will cause
    multi-arg mode to be used.  These commas were formerly interpreted
    as multi-statement operators within the first-and-only arg (Text).</li>
  <li>When Title is an expression, unescaped commas contained within the
    expression no longer interfere with smart comma handling.</li>
  <li>If there are exactly two args and the first is empty or an integer,
    multi-arg mode is used.  The former behaviour was to combine both
    into a single arg (Text).</li>
  <li>Timeout can be a literal number or a single deref (and optionally
    part of a number; for example, <code>%Timeout%.500</code>).  Contrary to the
    documentation, the former behaviour interpreted most other cases
    beginning with <code>%</code> as expressions (containing a double-deref).</li>
  <li>Title can be an expression even if Text and Options are omitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changed A_IsUnicode/A_IsCompiled to be defined as an empty string in ANSI versions/uncompiled scripts instead of being left undefined. This allows them to be checked without triggering <a href="commands/_Warn.htm">#Warn</a> warnings. Side effects include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Attempting to assign directly to A_IsCompiled or A_IsUnicode always causes a load-time error. Dynamic assignments always fail, either silently or with an error dialog as appropriate. Previously assignments were allowed in uncompiled/non-Unicode scripts.</li>
  <li>Attempting to take the address of A_IsCompiled or A_IsUnicode always fails.</li>
  <li>A_IsCompiled and A_IsUnicode no longer appear in ListVars when referenced by a script which is not compiled/Unicode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changed <a href="commands/Send.htm">Send</a> and related commands to respect <a href="commands/_MenuMaskKey.htm">#MenuMaskKey</a> when changing modifier keystates.</p>
<h4>Other changes:</h4>
<p>Changed <a href="commands/GuiControl.htm#Choose">GuiControl Choose</a> to remove the ListBox/ComboBox/DDL's current selection when N=0.</p>
<p>Changed <a href="commands/RegisterCallback.htm">RegisterCallback</a> to allow a <a href="objects/Func.htm">Func object</a> in place of a name.</p>
<p>Changed <a href="commands/ListLines.htm">ListLines</a> to show filenames (except when compiled).</p>
<p>Improved <a href="commands/Run.htm">Run</a> to output a process ID if possible when ShellExecuteEx is used.</p>
<h4>Fixes:</h4>
<p>Fixed handle leaks in RegRead.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>x.y++</code> and similar to assign an empty string if x.y is non-numeric.</p>
<p>Fixed SendInput Win+L workaround causing Win key to "stick down".</p>
<p>Fixed Ahk2Exe auto-including the wrong file if an auto-include used <a href="commands/_Include.htm">#Include &lt;Lib&gt;</a>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.05.06">1.1.05.06 - December 31, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed inc (++) and dec (--) having no effect when used on an object field containing a string.</p>
<p>Fixed inc (++) and dec (--) to cause a warning when used on an uninitialized variable.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.05.05">1.1.05.05 - December 17, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed <code>continue <i>n</i></code> misbehaving when an inner loop has no braces.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>RegExMatchObject[Name]</code> to work correctly with duplicate names.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.05.04">1.1.05.04 - December 5, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed: Selected sub-command of ControlGet was unreliable on x64.</p>
<p>Fixed: CPU was maxed out while waiting if an underlying thread displayed a dialog (and possibly in other cases).</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.05.03">1.1.05.03 - November 30, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed <code>Loop ... Until VarContainingObject</code>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.05.02">1.1.05.02 - November 20, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed false detection of end-of-file when loading a compiled script in some cases.</p>
<p>Fixed SendInput to automatically release modifier keys when sending special characters or {U+xxxx} (which was broken by v1.1.00.01).</p>
<p>Fixed ComObjConnect to filter out non-dispatch interfaces instead of allowing the script to crash.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>new %VarContainingClassName%()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.05.01">1.1.05.01 - October 16, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed class declarations to allow directives such as #Include.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.05.00">1.1.05.00 - October 8, 2011</h2>
<p>Added <a href="commands/CoordMode.htm">Client coordinate mode</a>.</p>
<p>Added <a href="commands/RegExMatch.htm#ObjectMode">object output mode</a> for RegExMatch and RegEx callouts.</p>
<p>Added <a href="Functions.htm#SuperGlobal">super-global</a> declarations, which avoid the need to repeat global declarations.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking change:</strong> Class declarations such as <code>Class c</code> now create a super-global variable instead of an ordinary global.</p>
<p>Added more detail to unhandled exception error dialogs.</p>
<p>Changed <code><a href="commands/Gui.htm#Owner">Gui +Owner</a></code> to work even after the GUI is created.</p>
<p>Changed instance var declarations in class definitions to avoid leaving empty key-value pairs in the class object.</p>
<p>Changed #Include to use standard error message formatting when it fails (more detail; also respects ErrorStdOut).</p>
<p>Changed <a href="commands/Throw.htm">Throw</a> to throw an Exception object by default when its parameter is omitted.</p>
<p>Changed format of runtime error messages slightly to improve consistency and code size.</p>
<p>Modified PCRE to use UTF-16 for input on Unicode builds, for performance.</p>
<p>Upgraded PCRE to 8.13.</p>
<p>Fixed thread not exiting as intended when an assignment in an expression fails.</p>
<p>Fixed #MaxMem preventing assignments to variables which don't require expansion.</p>
<p>Fixed inability of Try/Catch to catch COM errors.</p>
<p>Fixed GuiControlGet incorrectly treating parameter #2 as invalid in some cases.</p>
<p>Fixed input vars being resolved too soon, allowing them to be invalidated by an expression later on the same line.</p>
<p>Fixed RegEx callouts not causing matching to abort when an exception is thrown.</p>
<p>Fixed DllCall setting ErrorLevel to -4 when it should be -3.</p>
<p>Fixed While appearing twice in ListLines for its first iteration.</p>
<p>Fixed Try/Catch to allow If/Loop/For/While with no enclosing block.</p>
<p>Fixed enumerator object not being released when Until is used to break a For-loop.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.04.01">1.1.04.01 - September 15, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed FileRemoveDir setting ErrorLevel incorrectly.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.04.00">1.1.04.00 - September 11, 2011</h2>
<p><strong>This release contains a number of potentially script-breaking changes.</strong></p>
<p>Added exception handling support: <a href="commands/Try.htm">try</a>/<a href="commands/Catch.htm">catch</a>/<a href="commands/Throw.htm">throw</a> and <a href="commands/Throw.htm#Exception">Exception()</a>.</p>
<p>Added StdOut mode for <a href="commands/_Warn.htm">#Warn</a>.</p>
<p>Added <a href="commands/Gui.htm#GuiHwndOutputVar">Gui +HwndVARNAME</a> option.</p>
<p>Added <a href="commands/Gui.htm#New">Gui, New [, Options, Title]</a>.</p>

<p>Changed GuiControl and GuiControlGet to allow a HWND to be passed in the <em>ControlID</em> parameter.</p>
<p>Removed the 1GB limit from FileRead.</p>
<p>Improved error detection:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Hotkey, If, <i>Expression</i></code>, where <i>Expression</i> does not match an existing #If expression, is caught at load-time when possible.</li>
  <li><code>Hotkey, If<i>Something</i></code>, where <i>Something</i> is invalid, is caught at load-time.</li>
  <li>Class definitions with missing braces are detected as errors.</li>
  <li>If a function call is used on the first line of a class definition, it is now correctly treated as an error.</li>
  <li>GroupAdd now shows an error message when the group name is blank, instead of silently exiting the thread.</li>
  <li>Removed some redundant "unset var" warnings which appeared when using the OutputDebug or StdOut warning modes.</li>
  <li>If an unrecognized option is used with <a href="commands/Gui.htm#Options">Gui</a>, <a href="commands/Gui.htm#Show">Gui Show</a>, <a href="commands/Gui.htm#New">Gui New</a> or <a href="commands/GuiControl.htm">GuiControl</a>, an error message is shown and the thread exits unless <a href="commands/Try.htm">try</a> is used. This validation is not done at load-time due to complexity (it is common for the option parameters to contain variable references).</li>
  <li>RegRead, RegWrite and RegDelete now set A_LastError to the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function.</li>
  <li><a href="commands/Gui.htm#LastFoundExist">+LastFoundExist</a> is now treated as an error if it is combined with another option (<a href="commands/Gui.htm#LastFound">+LastFound</a> should be used in that case).</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed a <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic76133.html">bug</a> affecting recursive variadic functions.</p>

<h2 id="v1.1.00.00">1.1.00.00 - May 1, 2011</h2>
<h4>New features:</h4>
<p>Implemented basic <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes">class definition syntax</a>.</p>
<p>Implemented the <code><a href="Objects.htm#Custom_NewDelete">new</a></code> keyword for creating a derived object.</p>

<p>Added support for <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> with object fields, such as <code>x.y[z]++</code>.</p>

<h4>Changes:</h4>
<p>Changed __Delete to not trigger __Call.</p>
<p>Changed OnClipboardChange to use AddClipboardFormatListener when available (i.e. on Windows Vista and later) to improve reliability.</p>
<p>Auto-concat with <code>(</code> is more selective, so some invalid expressions like <code>12(34)</code> will no longer work.</p>

<h4>Fixes:</h4>
<p>Fixed <code>SetTimer Label, -0</code> to be treated as "run-once, very soon".</p>
<p>Fixed A_MyDocuments etc. to use SHGetFolderPath instead of undocumented registry keys.</p>
<p>Fixed non-empty ExcludeText causing windows with no text to be excluded.</p>

<h2 id="v1.0.97.02">1.0.97.02 - April 14, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed misinterpretation of comma as an arg delimiter when enclosed in <code>{}</code> in an expression.</p>

<p>Added <code>{key: value}</code> as syntax sugar for <code>Object("key", value)</code>.</p>
<p>Added <code>[x, y, z]</code> as syntax sugar for <code>Array(x, y, z)</code>, which is a new function equivalent to  <code>Object(1, x, 2, y, 3, z)</code>.</p>
<p>Added slight optimization: resolve any reference to True, False, A_PtrSize or A_IsUnicode in expressions at load-time.</p>
<p>Fixed hotkey parser to treat <code>x & ^y</code> as an error instead of ignoring <code>^</code>.</p>

<h2 id="v1.0.96.00">1.0.96.00 - March 21, 2011</h2>
<h4><b>New features:</b></h4>
<p><a href="commands/ComObjQuery.htm">ComObjQuery</a>: Queries a COM object for an interface or service.</p>
<p><a href="commands/ComObjFlags.htm">ComObjFlags</a>: Retrieves or changes flags which control a COM wrapper object's behaviour.</p>
<p><a href="commands/ComObjCreate.htm">ComObjCreate</a> allows non-dispatch objects to be created if an interface identifier (IID) is given.</p>
<p><a href="commands/ComObjArray.htm">COM arrays</a> support for-loops and the Clone() method.</p>
<p>ListVars shows the inner variant type and value of each COM wrapper object, in addition to the wrapper's address.</p>
<h4><b>Changes:</b></h4>
<p>When a literal integer or variable containing both a numeric string and cached binary integer is assigned to a field of an object, an integer is stored instead of a string. This particularly benefits scripts calling COM methods which accept integers but not strings, or have different behaviour depending on the type of value.</p>
<p>NULL values are now allowed with ComObjParameter for the VT_UNKNOWN and VT_DISPATCH types.</p>
<p>Improved support for Common Language Runtime (.NET) objects via COM.</p>
<p>FileRecycle should now warn before deleting a file which is too large to recycle.</p>
<p>When a SafeArray created with ComObjArray is assigned to an element of another SafeArray, a separate copy is created. This prevents the script from crashing due to a second attempt at "destroying" the array. ComObjFlags allows this behaviour to be avoided.</p>
<h4><b>Fixes:</b></h4>
<p>Assigning to a COM array of VT_DISPATCH or VT_UNKNOWN crashed the script.</p>
<p>Break and Continue were tolerated outside of loops in some cases.</p>
<p>Standalone carriage-return (`r) was not correctly interpreted as end-of-line.</p>
<p>MouseMove miscalculated negative coordinates with the Input and Event send modes.</p>
<p>Selecting <i>Edit This Script</i> from the tray menu or using the Edit command crashed the script (broken by v1.0.95).</p>
<p>Error dialogs pointed at irrelevant lines of code in some cases.</p>

<h2 id="v1.0.95.00">1.0.95.00 - March 12, 2011</h2>
<p>All file I/O has been heavily optimized.</p>
<p>Added <a href="commands/_Warn.htm">#Warn</a> to assist with debugging; initial design by <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48847">ac</a>.</p>
<p>By default, if <i>name_var</i> contains a function name, <code>name_var.()</code> calls the function. This can be overidden via the <a href="Objects.htm#Default_Base_Object">default base object</a>, as before.</p>
<p>Run supports verbs with parameters, such as <code>Run *RunAs %A_ScriptFullPath% /Param</code>.</p>
<p>If an operator which can accept either one operand (<code>&amp;x</code>) or two <i>numeric</i> operands (<code>x & y</code>) follows a quoted literal string, auto-concat occurs and the operator is applied only to the right-hand operand. This is because quoted literal strings are always considered non-numeric and are therefore not valid input for numeric operators. For example, expressions like <code>"x" &amp;y</code> and <code>"x" ++y</code> now work.</p>
<p><b>Fixed:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Wildcard hotkeys were not respecting modifiers such as <code>^!+</code> in specific cases.</li>
<li>File.Pos returned garbage for non-seeking file types; now it returns -1.</li>
<li>File.AtEOF was incorrectly true in some cases.</li>
<li>COM wrapper objects left A_LastError unset in some cases.</li>
<li>Gui submenu icons did not work on Windows 2000/XP/Server 2003.</li>
<li>SplashImage clipped the image if height > width.</li>
<li>ComObjConnect did not alert when the first parameter is invalid.</li>
<li>SplashImage now uses GDI+ only when the other methods fail, for compatibility.</li>
<li>Tilde in <code>~x::</code> now affects <code>x & y::</code> in the same way that <code>~x & z::</code> would, instead of having no effect.</li>
<li>A_PriorHotkey and A_TimeSincePriorHotkey now have the expected values when used with #If.</li>
<li>RegExReplace did not advance through the string correctly after a match failure if the string contained non-ASCII characters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="v1.0.92.02">1.0.92.02 - January 19, 2011</h2>
<p>Fixed a memory leak which occurred when the return value of an object invocation or built-in function was not used, such as <code>file.ReadLine()</code> or <code>SubStr(x,y,z)</code> alone on a line.</p>
<p>Replaced the fix from v1.0.92.01 with a better fix, which also fixes <code>k::MsgBox(),x:=y</code> and doesn't break <code>if()</code>.</p>

<p>COM: Added protection against NULL IDispatch/IUnknown pointers.</p>
<p>COM: Skip QueryInterface for IDispatch if VT_DISPATCH is passed explicitly.</p>
<p>Minor fix for maintainability: <code>obj.field := var</code> now correctly yields SYM_STRING, not SYM_OPERAND.</p>

<h2 id="v1.0.91.01">1.0.91.01 - December 24, 2010</h2>
<p>Fixed: Unexpected results with <code>File.Write(Str)</code> after text-reading.</p>
<p>Fixed: UTF BOM check caused unexpected results in files without a BOM.</p>
<p>Fixed (ANSI): Parsing loops and <code>File.ReadLine()</code> treated <code>Chr(255)</code> as EOF.</p>
<p>Fixed (Unicode): RegExReplace errors where the UTF-8 and UTF-16 lengths differed.</p>
<p>Fixed: Disabling the last hook hotkey breaks Input.</p>
<p>Added: Simple optimization for RegExMatch/Replace.</p>

<h2 id="v1.0.91.00">1.0.91.00 - December 21, 2010</h2>
<p><i>All changes in this release are COM-related.</i></p>
<p>Added: <a href="commands/ComObjError.htm">ComObjError</a> now returns the previous setting.</p>
<p>Added: <a href="commands/ComObjType.htm">ComObjType(co)</a> and <a href="commands/ComObjValue.htm">ComObjValue(co)</a>.</p>
<p>Added: <a href="commands/ComObjActive.htm">ComObjMissing()</a>.</p>
<p>Added: <a href="commands/ComObjArray.htm">ComObjArray()</a> and basic SAFEARRAY support.</p>
<p>Added: "Take ownership" parameter for <a href="commands/ComObjActive.htm">ComObjParameter()</a>.</p>
<p>Changed: Values passed to COM functions via ComObjParameter are no longer freed in the process of calling the function.</p>
<p>Changed: <code>ComObj.x()</code> now falls back to PROPERTYGET if member 'x' is not found. This fixes for-loops for some objects.</p>
<p>Changed: Wrap unhandled variant types in an object rather than returning integer value.</p>
<p>Changed: Manage VT_UNKNOWN/VT_ARRAY lifetime automatically, by default.</p>

<h2 id="v1.0.90.00">1.0.90.00 - November 27, 2010</h2>

<h2 id="L61">Revision 61 - October 3, 2010</h2>
<p>Added: <code>ObjClone(Object)</code>, forgotten when <code>Object.Clone()</code> was implemented.</p>
<p>Added: Support for RegEx Unicode properties in Unicode builds. Also upgraded PCRE to 8.10.</p>
<p>Added: <code>Object.Remove(int, "")</code> removes <code>Object[int]</code> without affecting other keys.</p>
<p>Changed: <code>ComObj.xyz()</code> is now always treated as a method-call.</p>
<p>Changed: <code>Var := 123</code> is now left as an expression, for consistency. This makes <code>Var := 123</code> and <code>Var := (123)</code> equivalent, whereas previously the former assigned only a string and the latter assigned both a string and a cached binary integer. In particular, this avoids some confusing type mismatch errors with COM objects.</p>

<p>Fixed: Buffer overflow in A_EndChar when there is no end char.</p>
<p>Fixed: Func->mNextFunc not inititialized to NULL (used only by LowLevel scripts).</p>
<p>Debugger: Added the capability to retrieve an object's contents (with a supported debugger client).</p>
<p>Debugger: Fixed a few bugs.</p>

<p>Debugger: Encode stdout and stderr packets as UTF-8.</p>
<p>Debugger: Allow user to Abort, <b>Retry</b> or Ignore when the initial connection fails.</p>
<p>Debugger: Allow <a href="Scripts.htm#debug_attach">attaching a debugger client</a> by sending the script a registered window message.</p>

<p>Enhanced usability and capabilities of FileOpen/File object.</p>
<ul>
  <li>FileOpen's <i>Flags</i> parameter accepts a human-readable string of flags.</li>
  <li>FileOpen's "update" mode has been renamed "read/write" and now creates the file if it didn't already exist.</li>
  <li>FileOpen sets A_LastError as appropriate.</li>
  <li><code>File := FileOpen(handle,"h")</code> wraps an existing file handle in an object.</li>
  <li><code>File.Seek(n)</code> defaults to SEEK_END when n is negative.</li>
  <li><code>File.Pos</code> (or <code>File.Position</code>) can be used in place of Tell and Seek.</li>

  <li><code>File.Length</code> can be set, as in <code>File.Length:=n</code>.</li>
  <li><code>File.Read<i>Num</i>()</code> and <code>File.Write<i>Num</i>(n)</code> read or write a number, where <i>Num</i> is a NumGet-compatible type name.</li>
  <li><code>File.WriteLine(s)</code> is equivalent to <code>File.Write(s "`n")</code>, for symmetry with <code>File.ReadLine()</code>.</li>

<p>Fixed: Files were improperly locked while reading, unlike in older versions.</p>
<p>Fixed: Uppercase Hex format caused negative integers to become unsigned.</p>
<p>Fixed: RegExMatch was corrupting output array items when specific conditions were met. See <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic59120.html">bug report</a>.</p>

<p>Changed: Use &lt;EXENAME&gt;.ahk instead of AutoHotkey.ini or AutoHotkey.ahk.</p>
<p>Changed: Default to UTF-8 for script files; override with /CPnnn.</p>
<p>Fixed: Unpause when the script exits so that object __Delete meta-functions can run.</p>

<h2 id="L50">Revision 50 - March 27, 2010</h2>
<p>Improved flexibility of <a href="objects/Object.htm#Insert">Object._Insert</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Object._Insert(x)</code> - inserts x at <code>_MaxIndex()="" ? 1 : _MaxIndex() + 1</code>.</li>
  <li><code>Object._Insert(i,x,y,z)</code> - inserts <code>x,y,z</code> at <code>i,i+1,i+2</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improved flexibility of <a href="objects/Object.htm#Remove">Object._Remove</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>Object._Remove(k)</code> - removes and returns the value associated with k.</li>
  <li><code>Object._Remove()</code> - removes and returns the value at _MaxIndex().</li>

<h2 id="L49">Revision 49 - March 14, 2010</h2>
<p>Added <a href="objects/Object.htm#NewEnum">obj._NewEnum()</a>.</p>
<p>Added <a href="objects/Object.htm">ObjMethod(obj)</a> for each built-in <code>obj._Method()</code>.</p>
<p>Changed: ObjSet/Get/Call can no longer be called/overridden by script.</p>
<p>Fixed: Potential crash caused by VK_PACKET check added in L48.</p>
<p>Fixed: Character codes in VK_PACKET events were potentially misinterpreted as scancodes.</p>
<p>Fixed: ExcludeText was ineffective after the first matching control.</p>

<h2 id="L48">Revision 48 - February 21, 2010</h2>
<p>Fixed: Standalone <code>obj.()</code> was not recognized as a valid expression.</p>
<p>ControlSend now uses WM_CHAR to support characters which have no associated keycode.  For instance, this applies to "&#8230;" (en-US), "&#x221e;" in a Unicode build and <code>{U+221e}</code> in either build.</p>
<p>KeyHistory now shows the full 16-bit character code for VK_PACKET (VK=E7) events.  <a href="commands/Send.htm#Unicode">Send</a> may indirectly cause these to be generated for Unicode characters.</p>

<h2 id="L47">Revision 47 - February 13, 2010</h2>
<p>Fixed (Unicode): ControlGet,List with ListView controls.</p>

<h2 id="L46">Revision 46 - February 11, 2010</h2>
<p>Added A_FileEncoding, which returns the current default file encoding.</p>

<h2 id="L45">Revision 45 - February 8, 2010</h2>
<p>Added _GetAddress; _SetCapacity/_GetCapacity may now operate on a given field.  <a href="objects/Object.htm">[more info]</a></p>
<p>Added workaround for WM_PAINT infinite loop often caused by subclassing.</p>
<p>Allow <code>obj.()</code> as a means to call the default method of an object; equivalent to <code>obj[""]()</code>.</p>
<p>Dev: Added solution and project files for MSBuild 4.0 & VS2010.  <a href="http://github.com/Lexikos/AutoHotkey_L/commit/ed81ea089c223b46c883036c14454aa4386d3801">[more info]</a></p>
<p>Fixed (Unicode): 'Running' column in ListHotkeys.</p>

<h2 id="L44">Revision 44 - February 7, 2010</h2>
<p>Fixed: Attempting to set "nothing" crashed the script. For instance, <code>x[]:=z</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed (Unicode): Unable to find default script (Documents\AutoHotkey.ahk).</p>
<p>Fixed (Unicode): A_Desktop, A_ProgramFiles and several other built-in variables which read their value from the registry caused strings to be incorrectly terminated.</p>
<p>Fixed (ANSI): Characters in the range 0x80-0xFF couldn't be found by InStr or StringReplace.</p>
<p>Changed (ANSI): Treat ToCodePage/FromCodePage like other unsupported/invalid subcommands.</p>

<h2 id="L43">Revision 43 - January 29, 2010</h2>
<p>Fixed: obj.Func() resulting in a random integer when it should be an empty string.</p>

<h2 id="L42">Revision 42 - January 28, 2010</h2>
<p>Merged with AutoHotkeyU.</p>
<p>Numerous bug-fixes and improvements, some relating to the merge.</p>

<h2 id="L41">Revision 41 - December 20, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: Floating-point numbers were equivalent to an empty string when used as keys in objects.  They are now converted to numeric strings in the current <a href="commands/SetFormat.htm">float format</a>, as originally intended.</p>

<h2 id="L40">Revision 40 - December 13, 2009</h2>
<p>Changed meta-functions and multi-param behaviour to improve flexibility.  Meta-functions are now invoked *before* searching for an appropriate field in each base object; however, values in x.base will override meta-functions defined in x.base.base.  Chaining meta-functions (inheritence) is now possible by avoiding "Return"</p>
<p>Improved Default Base functionality to be more consistent with real objects.</p>
<p>Changed (Debugger): While stepping through code, skip all braces except those which end a function.</p>
<p>Changed (Debugger): When stepping onto the hidden "Exit" at end of the script, consider it to be *below* the last physical line to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2 id="L39">Revision 39 - December 2, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed (Debugger): Error in Base64 decoding used by property_set.</p>

<h2 id="L38">Revision 38 - November 17, 2009</h2>
<p>Added: <a href="commands/_MenuMaskKey.htm">#MenuMaskKey</a> directive to change which key is used to mask Alt/Win keyup events.  See <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/topic22378.html">this thread</a> for background information.</p>
<p>Changed: If <code>x[1,2]:=3</code> creates an object for <code>x[1]</code>, it's base is no longer automatically set to <code>x.base</code>.  See <a href="Objects.htm#Subclassing_aoa">the documentation</a> for a method of controlling this behaviour.</p>  

<h2 id="L37">Revision 37 - November 7, 2009</h2>
<p>Added: Support for <code>obj[method_name](params)</code> object-call syntax.</p>

<h2 id="L36">Revision 36 - November 4, 2009</h2>
<p>Changed: If <code>x.y</code> or similar is immediately followed by an open-bracket (<code>[</code>), the right-most identifier preceding the bracket is treated as the first parameter of the operation.  For instance, <code>a.b.c[d]</code> is equivalent to <code>ObjGet(a.b,"c",d)</code> and <code>x.y[z]:=v</code> is equivalent to <code>ObjSet(x,"y",z,v)</code>. Previously each sub-expression preceding a bracket was evaluated separately.</p>
<p>Changed: If a method-call such as <code>x.y()</code> is followed immediately by an assignment, the parentheses are treated as brackets. For instance, <code>x.y(z):=v</code> is now equivalent to <code>ObjSet(x,"y",z,v)</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed: If(expr) and While(expr) with no delimiting space or comma.</p>  

<h2 id="L35">Revision 35 - October 25, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: Standalone expressions beginning with two or more "dots", such as <code>x.y.z()</code>. (Broken by L34.) Note that '(' or '[' or ':=' is still required.</p>

<h2 id="L34">Revision 34 - October 24, 2009</h2>
<p>Changed: Setting a value within an object to an empty string now stores the empty string rather than removing the key-value pair from the object.  _Remove can still be used to completely remove key-value pairs.</p>
<p>Changed: Command names must be terminated with a space, tab or comma.  The following characters no longer bypass this requirement: <code>&lt;&gt;:+-*/!~&amp;|^[]</code>.  For instance, syntax errors such as <code>MsgBox&lt; foo</code> and <code>If!foo</code> are now caught at load-time.</p>
<p>Fixed: Return now properly handles expressions which result in a variable containing an object.  For instance, <code>Return x:=y</code>, <code>Return (x)</code>, <code>Return x,...</code> and similar should work now (<code>Return x</code> already worked).</p>
<p>Fixed: Multi-parameter get/set did not correctly support meta-functions for multiple objects (such as for <code>x</code> <i>and</i> <code>x[y]</code> in the expression <code>x[y,z]</code>).</p>
<p>Fixed: Cascading object-assignments such as the <code>x[y]:=z</code> in <code>r:=x[y]:=z</code> could not yield numbers or objects - broken by L33.</p>
<p>Fixed: <code>x._Remove(y)</code> crashed the script or removed the wrong item if <code>x</code> did not contain <code>y</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed: <code>x.=y</code>, <code>if x.y=...</code> and similar.  May affect other expressions.</p>
<p>Fixed: Standalone ternary expressions no longer requires spaces.  For instance, <code>x? F(1) : F(2)</code> is now allowed.</p>
<p>Debugger: On script exit, disconnect debugger *after* releasing objects to allow debugging of __Delete handlers.</p>

<h2 id="L33">Revision 33 - October 3, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: Local variables were not automatically freed for functions which return objects or pure numbers.</p>
<p>Fixed: Two separate reference-counting errors related to ternary operator and Object().</p>
<p>Fixed: If a string returned by a scripted object function was assigned directly to a variable, the variable's length was set incorrectly.</p>
<p>Fixed: If the last operation in an expression retrieved a string from a temporary object, the object and string were freed prematurely.</p>
<p>Fixed: Numeric strings with special formatting were not preserved when returned from a function via a variable or passed to a recursive function.</p>
<p>Fixed: If the final result of an expression (other than for Return) is an object, correctly yield an empty string instead of silently aborting the thread.</p>
<p>Fixed: __Delete meta-functions sometimes overwrote temporary values in the deref buffer.</p>
<p>Added: An address retrieved via &amp;object may be cast back into an object reference by using Object(address).</p>  

<h2 id="L32">Revision 32 - September 26, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: Send/PostMessage crash when less than three parameters were specified.</p>

<h2 id="L31">Revision 31 - September 26, 2009</h2>
<p>Added: Object/array support and numerous minor changes to make this possible.</p>
<p>Added: Support for While(expression) with no delimiting space.</p>
<p>Added: Trim, LTrim, RTrim.</p>
<p>Added: A ~= B; equivalent to RegExMatch(A, B).  May be removed in a future revision.</p>
<p>Fixed: An incompatibility with LowLevel.</p>
<p>Changed: Characters [, ] and ? are no longer valid in variable names.  Consequently, ? (ternary) no longer requires a space on either side.</p>
<p>Changed: Optional parameters may now be omitted at any position in the parameter list of a non-dynamic function call. Since this works by automatically inserting the parameter's default value at load-time, it is not supported or allowed for dynamic function-calls.</p>
<p>Debugger: Various minor changes to make program flow easier to follow while stepping through code.</p>
<p>Optimization: If DllCall's first parameter is a literal string which identifies a function already present in memory, it is replaced with the actual address of the function.</p>
<p>Updated from v1.0.48.03 to v1.0.48.04.</p>

<h2 id="L30">Revision 30 - May 31, 2009</h2>
<p>Updated from v1.0.48.02 to v1.0.48.03.</p>

<h2 id="L29">Revision 29 - May 2, 2009</h2>
<p>All supported image formats may now be used as menu icons.  Currently it is necessary to specify "actual size" when setting the icon to preserve transparency on Windows Vista and later. For example:</p>
<pre>Menu, Icon, MenuItemName, Filename.png,, 0</pre>  

<h2 id="L28">Revision 28 - May 2, 2009</h2>
<p>Improved average-case performance of dynamic function calls by implementing binary search for function name look-ups. This change also applies to other areas, such as load-time resolution of function references in expressions and run-time resolution by OnMessage, RegisterCallback, etc.</p>  

<h2 id="L27">Revision 27 - April 26, 2009</h2>
<p>Updated from v1.0.48.00 to v1.0.48.02.</p>  

<h2 id="L26">Revision 26 - April 11, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: Menu icons were not drawn on items which have sub-menus if owner-drawing was in use.</p>
<p>Fixed: Menu icons were not freed if all menu items were deleted at once.</p>
<p>Changed (Source): Renamed AutoHotkey.sln to AutoHotkey_L.sln to allow VS window to be identified more easily.</p>  

<h2 id="L25">Revision 25 - March 30, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: Send {U+xxxx} correctly sets modifier key-state as with any normal key.</p>
<p>Fixed: Send {U+..xx} no longer triggers hotkey SCxx.</p>

<h2 id="L24">Revision 24 - March 30, 2009</h2>
<p>Added: Support for Send {U+xxxx}. SendInput() is used where available for proper unicode support, otherwise falls back to Alt+Numpad.</p>

<h2 id="L23">Revision 23 - March 30, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: GuiControl, Enable/Disable now only resets focus if the focused control was disabled.</p>  

<h2 id="L22">Revision 22 - March 26, 2009</h2>
<p>Optimized If var [not] in/contains MatchList, especially for long lists containing shorter fields.</p>  

<h2 id="L21">Revision 21 - March 16, 2009</h2>
<p>Minor optimizations to While. [thanks Chris]</p>
<p>Fixed (Debugger): Revisions 19 and 20 omitted timer threads from the call stack.</p>
<p>Fixed (Debugger): XML-reserved characters were not escaped in most situations.</p>
<p>Fixed (Debugger): Incorrect command and transaction_id were used in the final response before exiting the script.</p>  

<h2 id="L20">Revision 20 - February 27, 2009</h2>
<p>Changed: If an icon cannot be loaded with the new method, fall back to the old method.</p>

<h2 id="L19">Revision 19 - February 26, 2009</h2>
<p>Added: Gui, Font, qN option to set font quality/control anti-aliasing, where N is between 0 and 5.</p>
<p>Fixed: IL_Add now loads icons at the most appropriate size when multiple sizes exist.</p>
<p>Merged with AutoHotkey v1.0.48, introducing bug fixes, optimizations and other changes by Chris. Some AutoHotkey_L features were integrated into the mainstream release; changes to these features since previous revisions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Legacy behaviour is no longer applied to While - e.g. "While %x%" is correctly interpreted as a double-deref rather than as "While x".</li>
  <li>One-True-Brace style is now supported for While.</li>
  <li>Static vars may now be declared and initialized in assume-static functions.</li>
  <li>Passing too <em>few</em> parameters in a dynamic function call is no longer allowed, as it allows the function's caller to second-guess the function's designer, reduces the ability to detect script bugs at runtime, and may cause the application to crash if calling a built-in function.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="L18">Revision 18 - February 21, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: Incomplete bug-fix in previous revision causing concat followed by assignment to skip the rest of the expression in some cases.</p>

<h2 id="L17">Revision 17 - February 20, 2009</h2>
<p>Added: Menu icons via Icon and NoIcon sub-commands of the Menu command.</p>

<p>Changed: Load both small and large versions of custom tray icons to allow the correct icons to be shown in the appropriate places.</p>
<p>Fixed: Loading of icons from executable files at sizes other than the system small/large.</p>

<h2 id="L16">Revision 16 - February 4, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: Deleting a menu item partially deleted its associated sub-menu.</p>  

<h2 id="L15">Revision 15 - February 1, 2009</h2>
<p>Fixed: SetFormat's presence in a *compiled* script was not disabling binary number write-caching. SetFormat should now work correctly in compiled scripts.</p>

<h2 id="L14">Revision 14 - February 1, 2009</h2>
<p>Numerous bug-fixes and optimizations by Chris (pre-v1.0.48 beta).</p>
<p>Added: Support for regex callouts and the auto-callout option 'C'.</p>
<p>Changed: A_AhkVersion now includes the revision number. For instance, this is 1.0.47.07.L14.</p>

<h2 id="L9">Revision 9 - July 29, 2008</h2>
<p>Fixed: Allow Break/Continue in While.</p>
<p>Fixed: TrayTip in non-English Windows and possibly other side-effects of using Vista headers.</p>
