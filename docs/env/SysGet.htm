<h1>SysGet</h1>

<p>Retrieves screen resolution, multi-monitor info, dimensions of system objects, and other system properties.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SysGet</span>, OutputVar, <a href="#SubCommands">SubCommand</a> <span class="optional">, Value</span></pre>
<p>The <em>OutputVar</em> parameter is the name of the variable in which to store the result. The <em>SubCommand</em> and <em>Value</em> parameters are dependent upon each other and their usage is described below.</p>

<h2 id="SubCommands">Sub-commands</h2>
<p>For <em>SubCommand</em>, specify one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#MonitorCount">MonitorCount</a>: Retrieves the total number of monitors.</li>
  <li><a href="#MonitorPrimary">MonitorPrimary</a>: Retrieves the number of the primary monitor.</li>
  <li><a href="#Monitor">Monitor</a>: Retrieves the bounding coordinates of the specified monitor.</li>
  <li><a href="#MonitorWorkArea">MonitorWorkArea</a>: Retrieves the working area's bounding coordinates of the specified monitor.</li>
  <li><a href="#MonitorName">MonitorName</a>: Retrieves the name of the specified monitor.</li>
  <li><a href="#Numeric">(Numeric)</a>: Retrieve the corresponding value from the tables below.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="MonitorCount">MonitorCount</h3>
<p>Retrieves the total number of monitors.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SysGet</span>, OutputVar, MonitorCount</pre>
<p>Unlike SM_CMONITORS mentioned in the table below, this sub-command includes all monitors, even those not being used as part of the desktop.</p>

<h3 id="MonitorPrimary">MonitorPrimary</h3>
<p>Retrieves the number of the primary monitor.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SysGet</span>, OutputVar, MonitorPrimary</pre>
<p>In a single-monitor system, this will be always 1.</p>

<h3 id="Monitor">Monitor</h3>
<p>Retrieves the bounding coordinates of monitor number <em>N</em>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SysGet</span>, OutputVar, Monitor <span class="optional">, N</span></pre>
<p>If <em>N</em> is omitted, the primary monitor is used. The information is stored in four variables whose names all start with <em>OutputVar</em>. If <em>N</em> is too high or there is a problem retrieving the info, the variables are all made blank. For example:</p>
<pre>SysGet, Mon2, Monitor, 2
MsgBox, Left: %Mon2Left% -- Top: %Mon2Top% -- Right: %Mon2Right% -- Bottom %Mon2Bottom%.</pre>
<p>Within a <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a>, to create a set of variables that is global instead of local, <a href="../Functions.htm#Global">declare</a> <em>Mon2</em> as a global variable prior to using this command (the converse is true for <a href="../Functions.htm#AssumeGlobal">assume-global</a> functions). However, it is often also necessary to declare each variable in the set, due to a <a href="../Functions.htm#ArrayConfusion">common source of confusion</a>.</p>

<h3 id="MonitorWorkArea">MonitorWorkArea</h3>
<p>Retrieves the working area's bounding coordinates of monitor number <em>N</em>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SysGet</span>, OutputVar, MonitorWorkArea <span class="optional">, N</span></pre>
<p>Same as the <a href="#Monitor">Monitor sub-command</a> above except the area is reduced to exclude the area occupied by the taskbar and other registered desktop toolbars.</p>

<h3 id="MonitorName">MonitorName</h3>
<p>Retrieves the operating system's name of monitor number <em>N</em>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SysGet</span>, OutputVar, MonitorName <span class="optional">, N</span></pre>
<p>If <em>N</em> is omitted, the primary monitor is used.</p>

<h3 id="Numeric">(Numeric)</h3>
<p>Specify for <em>SubCommand</em> one of the numbers from the tables below to retrieve the corresponding value.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SysGet</span>, OutputVar, N</pre>
<p>The following example would store the number of mouse buttons in a variable named "MouseButtonCount": <code>SysGet, MouseButtonCount, 43</code>.</p>
