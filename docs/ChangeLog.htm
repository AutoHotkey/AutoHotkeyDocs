<h1>Changes &amp; New Features</h1>
<p><a href="v2-changes.htm">Changes from v1.1 to v2.0</a> covers the differences between v1.1 and v2.0.</p>
<p>For full technical details of changes, refer to <a href="https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/tree/alpha">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.12">2.0.12 - March 23, 2024</h2>
<p>Fixed Gui GetPos/GetClientPos when Gui has an owner window or +DPIScale.</p>
<p>Fixed Until preventing subfolder recursion in file loops.</p>
<p>Fixed DllCall to throw when arg type is UStr.</p>
<p>Fixed a memory leak occurring for each regex callout.</p>
<p>Fixed Send erroneously releasing a modifier due to a race condition. For example, <code>~LAlt::Send "{Blind}x"</code> intermittently released LAlt if some other keyboard hook was installed more recently than the script's own hook.</p>
<p>Fixed icon loader to prefer higher bit-depth when multiple bitmaps of the same size are present.</p>
<p>Fixed SendInput failing to release LCtrl if it had already released RAlt and the layout does not have AltGr.</p>
<p>Fixed key-up hotkeys not firing if the key repeats after modifiers change. For example, <code>F1::Send "{Ctrl down}"</code> should allow <code>F1 up::</code> to execute when the key is released even though Ctrl is down, but was not allowing it after key-repeat occurs.</p>
<p>Fixed an error message to refer to #HotIf rather than #IfWin. [PR #327]</p>
<p>Fixed OwnProps erroneously skipping properties with optional parameters.</p>
<p>Fixed inconsistent behaviour of cloned dynamic properties.</p>
<ul>
  <li>OwnProps not skipping cloned properties which require parameters.</li>
  <li>Parameters not being passed recursively to parameterless properties (i.e. to allow <code>a.b[c]</code> to evaluate as <code>(a.b)[c]</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed SysGetIPAddresses causing a Critical Error when the network subsystem is non-functional; e.g. in Windows safe mode.</p>
<p>Changed ControlGetFocus to return 0 when focus can't be determined, such as when a console window is active.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.11">2.0.11 - December 23, 2023</h2>
<p>Added a workaround for the first shown menu not accepting keyboard input on Windows 10.</p>
<p>Fixed the <a href="lib/Gui.htm#Add">Add method (Gui)</a> to support the ShortDate option for DateTime controls.</p>
<p>Fixed a reference counting error with multi-level function nesting.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>#include &lt;x&gt;</code> causing a load-time crash if used inside a function.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>ListView.Opt("NoSort")</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed a memory leak occurring when an object with no own properties is cloned.</p>
<p>Fixed #include and FileInstall (non-compiled) to compare file names <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/handling-sorting-in-your-applications#sort-strings-ordinally">ordinally</a>, not linguistically.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.10">2.0.10 - September 24, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed crashing when a named function hotkey is used after #HotIf.</p>
<p>Fixed numeric literals ending with a dot to not cause line continuation.</p>
<p>Fixed pre-increment/decrement to work with chained array indexing.</p>
<p>Fixed OnNotify/OnCommand applying styles only applicable to OnEvent.</p>
<p>Fixed FileExist/DirExist leaking handles when <code>emptydir\*</code> is used.</p>
<p>Fixed DirExist leaking handles when only files match.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.9">2.0.9 - September 17, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed stacking of hotstrings with the X option.</p>
<p>Fixed debugger not listing local vars if the function is at the bottom of the stack.</p>
<p>Fixed Gui threads to show on the debugger's call stack.</p>
<p>Fixed some combinations of &amp;/ByRef causing stack overflow in ExitApp.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.8">2.0.8 - September 11, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed ByRef parameters erroneously assigning the default value to the caller's VarRef if unset.</p>
<p>Fixed some issues affecting suppressed Alt/Ctrl/Shift/Win hotkeys, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>*LCtrl::</code> blocked LCtrl from the active window, but sending Alt-key combinations would fail because the system thinks Ctrl is down, and would therefore send WM_KEYDOWN instead of WM_SYSKEYDOWN.</li>
  <li><code>*LAlt::</code> caused the system to forget any prior <code>{LAlt DownR}</code>, so a remapping such as <code>LCtrl::LAlt</code> would not behave correctly while LAlt is physically down, even though LAlt was suppressed.</li>
  <li>Other potential issues where the system's low-level tracking of a modifier key doesn't match up with the logical state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed some issues affecting continuation sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Escape sequences in the Join option were translated twice, causing <code>````</code> to become one literal <code>`</code> instead of two, <code>``n</code> to become a linefeed, and similar.</li>
  <li><code>`"</code> or <code>`'</code> produced a literal backtick and ended the string, instead of producing a literal quote mark, if the continuation section was enclosed in quotes of the same type and lacked the <code>`</code> option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optimized the automatic escaping of quote marks and backtick in continuation sections.</p>
<p>Fixed breakpoint_list (debugger) returning duplicates on lines containing fat arrow functions.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>+BackgroundDefault</code> failing to override the Gui's BackColor property.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.7">2.0.7 - September 2, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed MouseClickDrag to allow X1 and Y1 to be omitted.</p>
<p>Fixed mouse AltTab hotkeys not suppressing execution of a prefix hotkey, such as <code>1::</code> for <code>1 &amp; WheelDown::AltTab</code>. (Broken by v2.0.4)</p>
<p>Fixed hook hotkeys not recognizing modifiers which are pressed down by SendInput.</p>
<p>Fixed A_AhkPath to not be reliant on the case/format of the command line used to launch the process.</p>
<p>Fixed heap corruption during window searches involving groups. (Broken by v2.0.6)</p>
<p><strong>Launcher</strong></p>
<p>Fixed #Requires not being detected if followed by a comment other than <code>; prefer <i>xxx</i></code>. (Broken by v2.0.6)</p>
<p>Fixed syntax detection misinterpreting multi-line auto-replace hotstrings.</p>
<p><strong>Window Spy</strong></p>
<p>Changed font to Segoe UI size 9, consistent with Dash.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.6">2.0.6 - August 30, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed some ambiguity with COM calls, such as <code>x.y</code> acting as <code>x.y()</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed breakpoint on control flow statement being "hit" when a fat arrow function on the line below it returns.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>Default :</code> to not merge with the line below it. This prevented <code>Default :</code> from being used at the end of a Switch block, and caused any subsequent line to take the line number of the Default.</p>
<p>Optimized ProcessGetPath, ProcessSetPriority and ProcessClose to not scan through all processes when given a valid PID, even if access to the process is denied.</p>
<p>Fixed inability of <code>LWin::Alt</code> to be used to activate some Alt key combos.</p>
<p>Fixed TypeError thrown by <code>x is y</code> to say "Class" rather than "Object".</p>
<p>Fixed WinTitle to support criteria longer than 1023 characters.</p>
<p>Fixed issues when <code>&amp;ref</code> is used on different aliases of the same variable.</p>
<p>Fixed optional parameter default expressions (other than simple literal values) preventing the use of assume-global/assume-static.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.5">2.0.5 - August 12, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed a memory leak caused by incorrect reference counting when an object is enumerated via COM. [PR# 325]</p>
<p>Fixed internal calls to __Enum to not call __Call.</p>
<p>Fixed error messages referring to parameter #65535.</p>
<p>Fixed incorrect IEnumVARIANT return count.</p>
<p>Fixed Download throwing OSError(0) when error should be non-zero.</p>
<p>Fixed LV.Add/Insert/Modify crashing when passed the minimum number of parameters.</p>
<p>Fixed stack traces to exclude calls to __new for Error subclasses.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.4">2.0.4 - July 3, 2023</h2>
<p>Changed the Reload button on error/warning dialogs to explicitly close the dialog, even if the current script instance isn't terminated.</p>
<p>Removed an optimization for <code>return var</code> which caused the variable to appear blank when accessed within a <code>finally</code> block.</p>
<p>Fixed Default (Switch) to allow space before the colon.</p>
<p>Fixed Array.Prototype.RemoveAt to return the removed value when Length is "explicitly omitted" with <code>unset</code> or <code>var?</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed crashing when a ComObject is passed to a for-loop with only the second variable specified.</p>
<p><strong>Changes merged from v1.1.37.00 and v1.1.37.01:</strong></p>
<p>Changed COM method and property calls to pass large integers as VT_I8, not VT_R8 (floating-point), so the original type and precision is retained. Integers in the 32-bit range are still passed as VT_I4.</p>
<p>Added support for multi-variable enumerators (for-loops) with IDispatch-wrapped AutoHotkey objects. Both the script invoking the object and the object itself must be running a supported AutoHotkey version.</p>
<p>Fixed omitted parameters to receive their default values rather than the "optional argument marker" when an AutoHotkey method is called via IDispatch (COM). The reverse translation was already done when <em>calling</em> COM methods in previous versions.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>VerCompare(a, "&gt;" b)</code> and reduced code size marginally.</p>
<p>Fixed AltTab-related load-time errors to be consistent with other errors.</p>
<p>Fixed errors thrown by a ComObject wrapper not being propagated correctly if it is called via an object/COM.</p>
<p>Fixed the Hotkey GUI control to allow setting the symbols <code>^</code>, <code>!</code> and <code>+</code> as hotkeys.</p>
<p>Fixed the Hotkey control to include modifiers when its value is set to a symbol.</p>
<p>Fixed potential misbehaviour of InputHook.KeyOpt() with single chars.</p>
<ul>
<li>Option removal potentially not affecting the corresponding SC.</li>
<li>Options potentially also being applied to sc000.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed a bug with custom combos where a set of hotkeys like <code>a &amp b::</code>, <code>a::</code> and <code>a up::</code> would fail to suppress the release of <kbd>a</kbd> if <code>a::</code> alone is disabled with #HotIf.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug where a key-down event is correctly suppressed by a hotkey, but sending an additional key-down with SendLevel &gt; 0 would prevent the subsequent key-up from being suppressed, even if the sent event is ignored due to #InputLevel.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>a &amp; b up::</code> not suppressing <kbd>b</kbd> if <code>a &amp; b::</code> is present but disabled by #HotIf.</p>
<p>Fixed an issue with hotkeys not firing due to a race condition. If a modifier hotkey such as <code>~*RWin::</code> called Send or GetKeyState too soon, the OS could report that RWin isn't down, so the hook's modifier state would be "corrected" and hotkeys would wrongly fire or fail to fire. This was likely to occur only if another keyboard hook was installed more recently than the script's own hook, since in that case the OS would not update key state until the other hook's thread has resumed and returned.</p>
<p>Fixed hotstrings to use the Last Found Window set by #HotIf.</p>
<p>Fixed an issue where any attempt to reinstall the keyboard or mouse hook would fail if the OS had automatically uninstalled the hook. It is still necessary to meet certain conditions before any such attempt can be made.</p>
<p>Optimized allocation of cached COM property names for built-in IDispatch.</p>
<p>Refactored code to support a build configuration for AutoHotkey as a DLL.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.3">2.0.3 - June 19, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed <code>Hotkey("a", "b")</code> to use the original function of "b", not "a". [PR #318]</p>
<p>Fixed FileSetAttribute crash when used in a File Reading Loop. [PR #323]</p>
<p>Fixed duplicate Gui control name errors to correctly abort the thread.</p>
<p>Fixed DateTime/MonthCal Range option not applying minimum value.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>s[x] =&gt; x</code> and other single-line properties starting with "s".</p>
<p>Fixed a bug with deleting a breakpoint on a static line containing <code>=&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed Button control not becoming default when clicked.</p>
<p>Fixed PixelSearch to unset X when pixel is not found.</p>
<p>Fixed hotstring with escape sequence causing next line to be skipped.</p>
<p>Fixed WinTitle ignoring character 1 when "ahk_" is at character 2.</p>
<p>Fixed remapping to utilize right-hand modifier already being down. For example, <code>+x::+y</code> will no longer release RShift to press LShift.</p>
<p>Changed error message for <code>a == b &amp;&amp; c()</code> and similar cases to avoid alluding to legacy <code>=</code>.</p>
<p>Improved error message for some cases of unintended line continuation.</p>
<p>Fixed reserved words to be permitted as method names, as documented.</p>
<p>Fixed duplicate OnMessage calls for some keyboard messages.</p>
<p>Fixed inter-referenced closures being deleted prematurely.</p>
<p>Fixed SetFont to permit leading spaces in the Options parameter.</p>
<p>Fixed sending of <code>{ASC nnnn}</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>a.base := a</code> to throw an error.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>x.y := unset</code> causing crashes or undefined behaviour.</p>
<p>Fixed GuiControl.Move() to be relative to the GUI's client area even when the GUI is not its parent.</p>
<p>Fixed Menu Add overwriting items which were appended by Menu Insert.</p>
<strong>Launcher</strong>
<p>Run Dash instead of showing the old Welcome page in the documentation, when run without parameters.</p>
<p>Fixed version selection GUI raising an error if Enter is pressed without selecting a version. [PR UX/#4]</p>
<p>Suppress errors when checking whether an absent version can be downloaded.</p>
<p>Fixed absent version download prompt to not show the UAC shield if UAC is disabled.</p>
<p>Fixed issues with #Requires interpretation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support omitting the "v" prefix.</li>
<li>Support operators (<code>&gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;= =</code>).</li>
<li>Support a single digit for the version.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Installation</strong>
<p>Fixed the default installation directory for command-line use.</p>
<p>Renamed the Start menu shortcut from "AutoHotkey" to "AutoHotkey Dash".</p>
<p>Fixed EnableUIAccess when running as SYSTEM.</p>
<p>Fixed EnableUIAccess to verify the private key when selecting a certificate.</p>
<strong>Dash</strong>
<p>Fixed Launch Config GUI to update the "Run as administrator" and "Run with UI access" options.</p>
<p>Fixed Up/Down key handling in the Launch Config GUI.</p>

<p>Fixed ToolTips intermittently appearing at the wrong position.</p>
<p>Fixed __Enum(unset) to permit a second variable for Array, Match and Gui.</p>
<p>Fixed #include &lt;&gt; error messages to show "Script library" rather than "Function library".</p>
<p>Fixed new threads being unable to prevent a message check with Critical.</p>
<p>Optimized conversion of DllCall type names.</p>
<p>Made some trivial but effective code size optimizations.</p>
