<h1>Changes &amp; New Features</h1>
<p><a href="v2-changes.htm">Changes from v1.1 to v2.0</a> covers the differences between v1.1 and v2.0.</p>
<p>For full technical details of changes, refer to <a href="https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/tree/alpha">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="v2.1-alpha.6">2.1-alpha.6 - September 20, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed bugs added by v2.1-alpha.5:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>return (){</code> being interpreted like <code>return return (){</code>.</li>
  <li>Closures not working inside function definition expressions.</li>
  <li>Some functions not seeing variables which are created due to assume-global assignments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="v2.1-alpha.5">2.1-alpha.5 - September 17, 2023</h2>
<p>Changed <code>Ctrl::Alt</code> to not send an unsuppressed <code>{Ctrl up}</code>. This was originally intended to work around an issue with system handling of the modifier keys, but was superseded by a better workaround in v2.0.8.</p>
<p>Added support for using WheelUp, WheelDown, WheelLeft and WheelRight on either side of a remapping.</p>
<p>Removed a length limitation for parameter default strings (but not expressions).</p>
<p>Optimized ternary by removing a redundant check for numericness.</p>
<p><strong>Changes applicable only to alpha users:</strong></p>
<p>Fixed a reference counting error in construction of nested structs.</p>
<p>Fixed issues with function definition expressions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Script failing to load if the function contains blocks.</li>
  <li><code>x::y(h?){</code> was implicitly permitted but was not behaving intuitively; it is now interpreted as though <code>y</code> was on a new line.</li>
  <li>Function definitions beginning within a fat arrow function or parameter initializer were incorrectly defined in the outer scope.</li>
  <li>The function's body was not identified correctly if it began within a fat arrow function, #HotIf, parameter initializer or class variable initializer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed <code>&amp;x:=unset</code> to be permitted.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.9">2.0.9 - September 17, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed stacking of hotstrings with the X option.</p>
<p>Fixed debugger not listing local vars if the function is at the bottom of the stack.</p>
<p>Fixed Gui threads to show on the debugger's call stack.</p>
<p>Fixed some combinations of &amp;/ByRef causing stack overflow in ExitApp.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.8">2.0.8 - September 11, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed ByRef parameters erroneously assigning the default value to the caller's VarRef if unset.</p>
<p>Fixed some issues affecting suppressed Alt/Ctrl/Shift/Win hotkeys, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>*LCtrl::</code> blocked LCtrl from the active window, but sending Alt-key combinations would fail because the system thinks Ctrl is down, and would therefore send WM_KEYDOWN instead of WM_SYSKEYDOWN.</li>
  <li><code>*LAlt::</code> caused the system to forget any prior <code>{LAlt DownR}</code>, so a remapping such as <code>LCtrl::LAlt</code> would not behave correctly while LAlt is physically down, even though LAlt was suppressed.</li>
  <li>Other potential issues where the system's low-level tracking of a modifier key doesn't match up with the logical state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed some issues affecting continuation sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Escape sequences in the Join option were translated twice, causing <code>````</code> to become one literal <code>`</code> instead of two, <code>``n</code> to become a linefeed, and similar.</li>
  <li><code>`"</code> or <code>`'</code> produced a literal backtick and ended the string, instead of producing a literal quote mark, if the continuation section was enclosed in quotes of the same type and lacked the <code>`</code> option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optimized the automatic escaping of quote marks and backtick in continuation sections.</p>
<p>Fixed breakpoint_list (debugger) returning duplicates on lines containing fat arrow functions.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>+BackgroundDefault</code> failing to override the Gui's BackColor property.</p>

<h2 id="v2.1-alpha.4">2.1-alpha.4 - September 4, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed bugs added by v2.1-alpha.3:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Control flow statement not recognized if followed immediately by a brace; e.g. <code>else{</code>.</li>
  <li>Static properties being erroneously merged into one line; e.g. <code>static Prop { get =&gt; 1 }</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="v2.1-alpha.3">2.1-alpha.3 - September 3, 2023</h2>
<p>Added <a href="Functions.htm#funcexpr">function definition expressions</a>.</p>
<p>Added typed properties (<a href="Structs.htm">structures</a>).</p>
<p>Added <code>Class(Name, BaseClass, Args*)</code> and <code>Class(BaseClass, Args*)</code> (see <a href="lib/Class.htm#StaticCall">Class.Call</a>).</p>
<p>Added support for left/right modifiers in {Blind}, as in <code>{Blind&gt;^}</code>.</p>
<p>Changed remapping to utilize left/right modifiers in Blind; e.g. <code>&gt;^a::b</code> remaps RCtrl-A to B and LCtrl-RCtrl-A to LCtrl-B, instead of just B.</p>
<p>Changed DllCall to permit CDecl to be omitted for all functions (see <a href="lib/DllCall.htm#cdecl">CDecl</a>).</p>
<p>Revised parsing of statements. Global, local and static variable declarations with multiple initializers are now evaluated as one, so there is no need to step over each initializer individually while debugging.</p>
<p>Changed ListVars to show unset vars as "varname: unset".</p>
<p>Changed Throw to be a function, permitting thrown errors to be continuable (see <a href="lib/Throw.htm#Remarks">Throw</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Changes applicable only to alpha users:</strong></p>
<p>Changed <code>(...)?</code> and <code>(...) ?? x</code> to never enable unset return. This eliminates inconsistencies, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>(a ? b : c)?</code> permitted only c to be unset, while <code>(a ? b? : c)?</code> permitted only b to be unset.</li>
  <li><code>(x.y)?</code> permitted y to return unset, while <code>(x?.y)?</code> did not.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed <code>a[b]:=unset</code> for Array and Map.</p>
<p>Fixed debugger failing to return typed sub-properties.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>a? .b</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>f(a?.b?)</code> incorrectly raising a load-time error.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.7">2.0.7 - September 2, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed MouseClickDrag to allow X1 and Y1 to be omitted.</p>
<p>Fixed mouse AltTab hotkeys not suppressing execution of a prefix hotkey, such as <code>1::</code> for <code>1 &amp; WheelDown::AltTab</code>. (Broken by v2.0.4)</p>
<p>Fixed hook hotkeys not recognizing modifiers which are pressed down by SendInput.</p>
<p>Fixed A_AhkPath to not be reliant on the case/format of the command line used to launch the process.</p>
<p>Fixed heap corruption during window searches involving groups. (Broken by v2.0.6)</p>
<p><strong>Launcher</strong></p>
<p>Fixed #Requires not being detected if followed by a comment other than <code>; prefer <i>xxx</i></code>. (Broken by v2.0.6)</p>
<p>Fixed syntax detection misinterpreting multi-line auto-replace hotstrings.</p>
<p><strong>Window Spy</strong></p>
<p>Changed font to Segoe UI size 9, consistent with Dash.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.6">2.0.6 - August 30, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed some ambiguity with COM calls, such as <code>x.y</code> acting as <code>x.y()</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed breakpoint on control flow statement being "hit" when a fat arrow function on the line below it returns.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>Default :</code> to not merge with the line below it. This prevented <code>Default :</code> from being used at the end of a Switch block, and caused any subsequent line to take the line number of the Default.</p>
<p>Optimized ProcessGetPath, ProcessSetPriority and ProcessClose to not scan through all processes when given a valid PID, even if access to the process is denied.</p>
<p>Fixed inability of <code>LWin::Alt</code> to be used to activate some Alt key combos.</p>
<p>Fixed TypeError thrown by <code>x is y</code> to say "Class" rather than "Object".</p>
<p>Fixed WinTitle to support criteria longer than 1023 characters.</p>
<p>Fixed issues when <code>&amp;ref</code> is used on different aliases of the same variable.</p>
<p>Fixed optional parameter default expressions (other than simple literal values) preventing the use of assume-global/assume-static.</p>

<h2 id="v2.1-alpha.2">2.1-alpha.2 - August 12, 2023</h2>
<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>
<p>Fixed load-time checks not detecting missing parameters for MenuSelect.</p>
<p>Fixed popup menus popping under the active GUI window if it is AlwaysOnTop.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizations</strong></p>
<p>Optimized Pause to allow the OS-level thread to sleep until messages are received, instead of polling the pause state frequently. In testing, this reduced CPU usage from 0.04% to 0.00%.</p>
<p>Optimized ProcessWaitClose and RunWait to allow the OS-level thread to sleep until the process handle is signaled or messages are received. This reduced CPU usage (as above) and improved the response time.</p>
<p>Optimized dialog window class checks.</p>
<p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<p>Changed ImageSearch and PixelSearch to allow X and Y to be omitted.</p>
<p>Changed ProcessWait to show "STILL WAITING" in ListLines, like WinWait.</p>
<p>Added support for returning <code>unset</code> from functions and properties, and allowing or handling it with the <a href="Variables.htm#maybe">maybe (?)</a> and <a href="Variables.htm#or-maybe">or-maybe (??)</a> operators.</p>
<p>Added optional chaining with the maybe operator (<code>a?.b</code>).</p>
<p>Added the <a href="Variables.htm#maybe-assign">maybe-assign operator (??=)</a>.</p>
<p>Changed property setters to allow the value parameter to be unset.</p>
<p>Improved load-time validation for <code>unset</code>, <code>?</code> and <code>??</code>.</p>
<p>Added an experimental directive, <a href="lib/_DefaultReturn.htm">#DefaultReturn unset|""</a>.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.5">2.0.5 - August 12, 2023</h2>
<p>Fixed a memory leak caused by incorrect reference counting when an object is enumerated via COM. [PR# 325]</p>
<p>Fixed internal calls to __Enum to not call __Call.</p>
<p>Fixed error messages referring to parameter #65535.</p>
<p>Fixed incorrect IEnumVARIANT return count.</p>
<p>Fixed Download throwing OSError(0) when error should be non-zero.</p>
<p>Fixed LV.Add/Insert/Modify crashing when passed the minimum number of parameters.</p>
<p>Fixed stack traces to exclude calls to __new for Error subclasses.</p>

<h2 id="v2.0.4">2.0.4 - July 3, 2023</h2>
<p>Changed the Reload button on error/warning dialogs to explicitly close the dialog, even if the current script instance isn't terminated.</p>
<p>Removed an optimization for <code>return var</code> which caused the variable to appear blank when accessed within a <code>finally</code> block.</p>
<p>Fixed Default (Switch) to allow space before the colon.</p>
<p>Fixed Array.Prototype.RemoveAt to return the removed value when Length is "explicitly omitted" with <code>unset</code> or <code>var?</code>.</p>
<p>Fixed crashing when a ComObject is passed to a for-loop with only the second variable specified.</p>
<p><strong>Changes merged from v1.1.37.00 and v1.1.37.01:</strong></p>
<p>Changed COM method and property calls to pass large integers as VT_I8, not VT_R8 (floating-point), so the original type and precision is retained. Integers in the 32-bit range are still passed as VT_I4.</p>
<p>Added support for multi-variable enumerators (for-loops) with IDispatch-wrapped AutoHotkey objects. Both the script invoking the object and the object itself must be running a supported AutoHotkey version.</p>
<p>Fixed omitted parameters to receive their default values rather than the "optional argument marker" when an AutoHotkey method is called via IDispatch (COM). The reverse translation was already done when <em>calling</em> COM methods in previous versions.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>VerCompare(a, "&gt;" b)</code> and reduced code size marginally.</p>
<p>Fixed AltTab-related load-time errors to be consistent with other errors.</p>
<p>Fixed errors thrown by a ComObject wrapper not being propagated correctly if it is called via an object/COM.</p>
<p>Fixed the Hotkey GUI control to allow setting the symbols <code>^</code>, <code>!</code> and <code>+</code> as hotkeys.</p>
<p>Fixed the Hotkey control to include modifiers when its value is set to a symbol.</p>
<p>Fixed potential misbehaviour of InputHook.KeyOpt() with single chars.</p>
<ul>
<li>Option removal potentially not affecting the corresponding SC.</li>
<li>Options potentially also being applied to sc000.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed a bug with custom combos where a set of hotkeys like <code>a &amp b::</code>, <code>a::</code> and <code>a up::</code> would fail to suppress the release of <kbd>a</kbd> if <code>a::</code> alone is disabled with #HotIf.</p>
<p>Fixed a bug where a key-down event is correctly suppressed by a hotkey, but sending an additional key-down with SendLevel &gt; 0 would prevent the subsequent key-up from being suppressed, even if the sent event is ignored due to #InputLevel.</p>
<p>Fixed <code>a &amp; b up::</code> not suppressing <kbd>b</kbd> if <code>a &amp; b::</code> is present but disabled by #HotIf.</p>
<p>Fixed an issue with hotkeys not firing due to a race condition. If a modifier hotkey such as <code>~*RWin::</code> called Send or GetKeyState too soon, the OS could report that RWin isn't down, so the hook's modifier state would be "corrected" and hotkeys would wrongly fire or fail to fire. This was likely to occur only if another keyboard hook was installed more recently than the script's own hook, since in that case the OS would not update key state until the other hook's thread has resumed and returned.</p>
<p>Fixed hotstrings to use the Last Found Window set by #HotIf.</p>
<p>Fixed an issue where any attempt to reinstall the keyboard or mouse hook would fail if the OS had automatically uninstalled the hook. It is still necessary to meet certain conditions before any such attempt can be made.</p>
<p>Optimized allocation of cached COM property names for built-in IDispatch.</p>
<p>Refactored code to support a build configuration for AutoHotkey as a DLL.</p>
