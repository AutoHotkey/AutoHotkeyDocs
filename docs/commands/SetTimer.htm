<h1>SetTimer</h1>

<p>Causes a subroutine to be launched automatically  and repeatedly at a specified time interval.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">SetTimer [, Label, Period|On|Off|Delete, Priority]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Label</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the <a href="../misc/Labels.htm">label</a> or <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey label</a> to which to jump, which causes the commands beneath <em>Label</em> to be executed until a <a href="Return.htm">Return</a> or <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> is encountered. As with the parameters of almost all other commands, <em>Label</em> can be a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a> reference such as %MyLabel%, in which case the name stored in the variable is used as the target.</p>
  <p><span class="ver">[v1.1.01+]:</span> If <em>Label</em> is omitted, <a href="../Variables.htm#ThisLabel">A_ThisLabel</a> will be used. For example, <code>SetTimer,, Off</code> can be used inside a timer subroutine to turn off the timer. <strong>Known limitation:</strong> SetTimer will use the value of A_ThisLabel even if the running timer called a function or object (not a label), or there is no timer running.</p>
  <p id="Functor"><span class="ver">[v1.1.20+]:</span> If not a valid label name, this parameter can be the name of a function, or a single variable reference containing a <a href="../objects/Functor.htm">function object</a>. For example, <code>SetTimer %funcobj%, 1000</code> or <code>SetTimer % funcobj, 1000</code>. Other expressions which return objects are currently unsupported. See <a href="#ExampleClass">the class example</a> for more details.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Period|On|Off|Delete</dt>
  <dd><p><strong>On</strong>: Re-enables a previously disabled timer at its former <em>period</em>. If the timer doesn't exist, it is created (with a default period of 250). The timer is also <a href="#reset">reset</a>. If the timer exists but was previously set to <a href="#once">run-only-once mode</a>, it will again run only once.</p>
      <p><strong>Off</strong>: Disables an existing timer.</p>
      <p><strong>Delete</strong> <span class="ver">[v1.1.20+]</span>: Disables and deletes an existing timer. If the timer is associated with a <a href="../objects/Functor.htm">function object</a>, the object is released. Turning off a timer does not release the object.</p>
      <p><strong>Period</strong>: Creates or updates a timer using the absolute value of this parameter as the <a href="#Precision">approximate</a> number of milliseconds that must pass before the timer is executed. The timer will be automatically enabled and <a href="#reset">reset</a>. It can be set to repeat automatically or run only once:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If <em>Period</em> is positive, the timer will auomatically repeat until it is explicitly disabled by the script.</li>
        <li id="once"><span class="ver">[v1.0.46.16+]:</span> If <em>Period</em> is negative, the timer will run only once. For example, specifying -100 would run the timer 100 ms from now then disable the timer as though <code>SetTimer, Label, Off</code> had been used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Period</em> must be an integer, unless a variable or expression is used, in which case any fractional part is ignored. Its absolute value must be no larger than 4294967295 ms (49.7 days).</p>
      <p><strong>Default</strong>: If this parameter is blank and:<br>
      1) the timer does not exist: it will be created with a period of 250.<br>
      2) the timer already exists: it will be enabled and <a href="#reset">reset</a> at its former <em>period</em> unless a <em>Priority</em> is specified.</p>

    </dd>

  <dt>Priority</dt>
  <dd><p>This optional parameter is an integer between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (or an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>) to indicate this timer's thread priority. If omitted, 0 will be used. See <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> for details.</p>
      <p>To change the priority of an existing timer without affecting it in any other way, leave the  parameter before this one blank.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>Timers are useful because they run asynchronously, meaning that they will run at the specified frequency (interval) even when the script is  waiting for a window, displaying a dialog, or busy with another task. Examples of their many uses include taking some action when the user becomes idle (as reflected by <a href="../Variables.htm#TimeIdle">A_TimeIdle</a>) or closing unwanted windows the moment they appear.</p>
<p>Although timers may give the illusion that the script is performing more than one task simultaneously, this is not the case. Instead, timed subroutines are treated just like other threads: they can interrupt or be interrupted by another thread, such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey subroutine</a>. See <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> for details.</p>
<p>Whenever a timer is created, re-enabled, or updated with a new <em>period</em>, its subroutine will not run right away; its time <em>period</em> must expire first. If you wish the timer's first execution to be immediate, use <a href="Gosub.htm">Gosub</a> to execute the timer's subroutine (however, this will not start a new thread like the timer itself does; so settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> will not start off at their defaults).</p>
<p id="reset"><strong>Reset</strong>: If SetTimer is  used on an existing timer and parameter #2 is a number or the word ON (or it is omitted), the timer is reset; in other words, the entirety of its period must elapse before its subroutine will run again.</p>
<p id="Precision"><strong>Timer precision</strong>: Due to the granularity of the OS's time-keeping system, <em>Period</em> is typically rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 or 15.6 milliseconds (depending on the type of hardware and drivers installed). For example, a <em>Period</em> between 1 and 10 (inclusive) is usually equivalent to 10 or 15.6 on Windows 2000/XP. A shorter delay may be achieved via Loop+Sleep as demonstrated at <a href="Sleep.htm#ShorterSleep">DllCall+<span class="NoIndent">timeBeginPeriod</span>+Sleep</a>.</p>
<p id="Reliability"><strong>Reliability</strong>: A timer might not be able to run as often as specified under the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Other applications are putting a heavy load on the CPU.</li>
  <li>The timer subroutine itself takes longer than its own period to run, or there are too many other competing timers (altering <a href="SetBatchLines.htm">SetBatchLines</a> may help).</li>
  <li>The timer has been interrupted by another <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, namely another timed subroutine, <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey subroutine</a>, or <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a> (this can be avoided via <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a>). If this happens and the interrupting thread takes a long time to finish, the interrupted timer will be effectively disabled for the duration. However, any other timers will continue to run by interrupting the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> that interrupted the first timer.</li>
  <li>The script is uninterruptible as a result of <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> or <a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt/Priority</a>. During such times, timers will not run. Later, when the script becomes interruptible again, any overdue timer will run once as soon as possible and then resume its normal schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although timers will operate when the script is <a href="Suspend.htm">suspended</a>, they will not run if the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> has &quot;<a href="Thread.htm">Thread NoTimers</a>&quot; in effect or whenever any thread is <a href="Pause.htm">paused</a>. In addition, they do not operate when the user is navigating through one of the script's menus (such as the tray icon menu or a menu bar).</p>
<p>Because timers operate by temporarily interrupting the script's current activity, their subroutines should be kept short (so that they finish  quickly) whenever a long interruption would be undesirable.</p>
<p><strong><a name="otherremarks"></a>Other remarks</strong>: Timers that stay in effect for the duration of a script should usually be created in the <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>. By contrast, a temporary timer might often be disabled by its own subroutine (see examples at the bottom of this page).</p>
<p>Whenever a timed subroutine is run, it starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed in the <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>.</p>
<p>If <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> response time is crucial (such as in games) and the script contains any timers whose subroutines take longer than about 5 ms to execute, use the following command to avoid any chance of a 15 ms delay. Such a delay would otherwise happen if a hotkey is pressed at the exact moment a timer thread is in its period of uninterruptibility:</p>
<pre><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a>, interrupt, 0  <em>; Make all threads always-interruptible.</em></pre>
<p>If a timer is disabled while its subroutine is currently running, that subroutine will continue until it completes.</p>
<p>The <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> feature shows how many timers exist and how many are currently enabled.</p>
<p>To keep a script running -- such as one that contains only timers -- use <a href="_Persistent.htm">#Persistent</a>.</p>

}</pre>
<p>Notes about the above example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We can also use <code>this.timer := this.Tick.<a href="../objects/Func.htm#Bind">Bind</a>(this)</code>.  When <code>this.timer</code> is called, it will effectively invoke <code>this.Tick.<a href="../objects/Func.htm#Call">Call</a>(this)</code> (except that <code>this.Tick</code> is not re-evaluated).  By contrast, <a href="ObjBindMethod.htm">ObjBindMethod</a> produces an object which invokes <code>this.Tick()</code>.</li>
  <li>If we rename <em>Tick</em> to <em>Call</em>, we can just use <code>this</code> directly instead of <code>this.timer</code>.  This also removes the need for the temporary variable.  However, ObjBindMethod is useful when the the object has multiple methods which should be called by different event sources, such as hotkeys, menu items, GUI controls, etc.</li>
