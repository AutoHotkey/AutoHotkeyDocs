<h1>SetTimer</h1>

<p>Causes a subroutine to be launched automatically  and repeatedly at a specified time interval.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">SetTimer [, Label, Period|On|Off|Delete, Priority]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Label</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the <a href="../misc/Labels.htm">label</a> or <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey label</a> to which to jump, which causes the commands beneath <em>Label</em> to be executed until a <a href="Return.htm">Return</a> or <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> is encountered. As with the parameters of almost all other commands, <em>Label</em> can be a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a> reference such as %MyLabel%, in which case the name stored in the variable is used as the target.</p>
  <p><span class="ver">[v1.1.01+]:</span> If <em>Label</em> is omitted, <a href="../Variables.htm#ThisLabel">A_ThisLabel</a> will be used. For example, <code>SetTimer,, Off</code> can be used inside a timer subroutine to turn off the timer.</p>
  <p id="Functor"><span class="ver">[v1.1.20+]:</span> If not a valid label name, this parameter can be the name of a function, or a single variable reference containing a <a href="../objects/Functor.htm">function object</a>. For example, <code>SetTimer %funcobj%, 1000</code> or <code>SetTimer % funcobj, 1000</code>. Other expressions which return objects are currently unsupported.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Period|On|Off|Delete</dt>
  <dd><p><strong>On</strong>: Re-enables a previously disabled timer at its former <em>period</em>. If the timer doesn't exist, it is created (with a default period of 250). If the timer exists but was previously set to <a href="#once">run-only-once mode</a>, it will again run only once.</p>
      <p><strong>Off</strong>: Disables an existing timer.</p>
      <p><strong>Delete</strong> <span class="ver">[v1.1.20+]</span>: Disables and deletes an existing timer. If the timer is associated with a <a href="../objects/Functor.htm">function object</a>, the object is released. Turning off a timer does not release the object.</p>
      <p><strong>Period</strong>: Creates or updates a timer. <em>Period</em> defines the time span in <a href="#Precision">approximate</a> milliseconds that must pass before the jump to <em>Label</em>. The time span counts from the last time the timer was <a href="#reset">enabled</a>. The sign of <em>Period</em> defines whether the jump will be repeated:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a name="repeated" id="repeated"></a>A positive <em>Period</em> specifies that, when the time span has passed, the timer will be <a href="#reset">enabled</a> again. To prevent this, call the command a second time immediately afterward, specifying OFF for this parameter.</li>
      <li><strong<a name="once" id="once"></a><span class="ver">[v1.0.46.16+]:</span> A negative <em>Period</em> lets the timer run only once. For example, specifying -100 would run the timer 100&nbsp;ms from now and then disable the timer as though <code>SetTimer, Label, Off</code> had been used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Period</em> must be an integer, unless a variable or expression is used, in which case any fractional part is ignored. The value can be no larger than 4294967295&nbsp;ms (49.7 days).</p>
  <p><strong><a name="noparam2" id="noparam2"></a>Default:</strong>If this parameter is blank  and:<br>
      1) the timer does not exist: it will be created with a period of 250.<br>
      2) the timer already exists: it will be <a href="#reset">enabled</a> at its former <em>period</em> unless a <em>Priority</em> is specified.</p>
    </dd>

  <dt>Priority</dt>
  <dd><p>This optional parameter is an integer between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (or an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>) to indicate this timer's thread priority. If omitted, 0 will be used. See <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> for details.</p>
      <p>To change the priority of an existing timer without affecting it in any other way, leave the  parameter before this one blank.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>Timers are useful because they run asynchronously, meaning that they will run at the specified frequency (interval) even when the script is  waiting for a window, displaying a dialog, or busy with another task. Examples of their many uses include taking some action when the user becomes idle (as reflected by <a href="../Variables.htm#TimeIdle">A_TimeIdle</a>) or closing unwanted windows the moment they appear.</p>
<p>Although timers may give the illusion that the script is performing more than one task simultaneously, this is not the case. Instead, timed subroutines are treated just like other threads: they can interrupt or be interrupted by another thread, such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey subroutine</a>. See <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">Threads</a> for details.</p>
<p>Whenever a timer is <a href="#reset">enabled</a>, it will not jump to the <em>label</em> right away; its time <em>period</em> must expire first. If you wish the timer's first execution to be immediate, use <a href="Gosub.htm">Gosub</a> to execute the timer's subroutine (however, this will not start a new thread like the timer itself does; so settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> will not start off at their defaults).</p>
<p><a name="reset"></a><strong>Time of last run</strong>: A timer's internal &quot;time it was last run&quot is reset to the current time whenever the timer is enabled or re-enabled, that is, when SetTimer is used with either of the following for parameter #2:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>ON,</li>
      <li>a number expressing a <em>period</em>,</li>
      <li>none, for the default.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>This means that the entirety of its period must elapse before its subroutine will run again. </p> 
<p><strong><a name="Precision"></a>Timer precision</strong>: Due to the granularity of the OS's time-keeping system, <em>Period</em> is typically rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 or 15.6 milliseconds (depending on the type of hardware and drivers installed). For example, a <em>Period</em> between 1 and 10 (inclusive) is usually equivalent to 10 or 15.6 on Windows 2000/XP. A shorter delay may be achieved via Loop+Sleep as demonstrated at <a href="Sleep.htm#ShorterSleep">DllCall+<span class="NoIndent">timeBeginPeriod</span>+Sleep</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a name="Reliability"></a>Reliability</strong>: A timer might not be able to run as often as specified under the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Other applications are putting a heavy load on the CPU.</li>
  <li>The timer subroutine itself takes longer than its own period to run, or there are too many other competing timers (altering <a href="SetBatchLines.htm">SetBatchLines</a> may help).</li>
  <li>The timer has been interrupted by another <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, namely another timed subroutine, <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey subroutine</a>, or <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a> (this can be avoided via <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a>). If this happens and the interrupting thread takes a long time to finish, the interrupted timer will be effectively disabled for the duration. However, any other timers will continue to run by interrupting the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> that interrupted the first timer.</li>
  <li>The script is uninterruptible as a result of <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> or <a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt/Priority</a>. During such times, timers will not run. Later, when the script becomes interruptible again, any overdue timer will run once as soon as possible and then resume its normal schedule.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although timers will operate when the script is <a href="Suspend.htm">suspended</a>, they will not run if the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> has &quot;<a href="Thread.htm">Thread NoTimers</a>&quot; in effect or whenever any thread is <a href="Pause.htm">paused</a>. In addition, they do not operate when the user is navigating through one of the script's menus (such as the tray icon menu or a menu bar).</p>
<p>Because timers operate by temporarily interrupting the script's current activity, their subroutines should be kept short (so that they finish  quickly) whenever a long interruption would be undesirable.</p>
<p><strong><a name="otherremarks"></a>Other remarks</strong>: Timers that stay in effect for the duration of a script should usually be created in the <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>. By contrast, a temporary timer might often be disabled by its own subroutine (see examples at the bottom of this page).</p>
<p>Whenever a timed subroutine is run, it starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed in the <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>.</p>
<p>If <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> response time is crucial (such as in games) and the script contains any timers whose subroutines take longer than about 5 ms to execute, use the following command to avoid any chance of a 15 ms delay. Such a delay would otherwise happen if a hotkey is pressed at the exact moment a timer thread is in its period of uninterruptibility:</p>
<pre><a href="Thread.htm">Thread</a>, interrupt, 0  <em>; Make all threads always-interruptible.</em></pre>
<p>If a timer is disabled while its subroutine is currently running, that subroutine will continue until it completes.</p>
<p>The <a href="KeyHistory.htm">KeyHistory</a> feature shows how many timers exist and how many are currently enabled.</p>
<p>To keep a script running -- such as one that contains only timers -- use <a href="_Persistent.htm">#Persistent</a>.</p>
