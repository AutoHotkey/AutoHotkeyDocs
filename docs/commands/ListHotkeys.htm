<h1>ListHotkeys</h1>

<p>Displays the hotkeys in use by the current script, whether their subroutines are currently running, and whether or not they use the <a href="_InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard</a> or <a href="_InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse</a> hook.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">ListHotkeys</pre>
<p>This command is equivalent to selecting the View-&gt;Hotkeys menu item in the main window.</p>
<p>If a hotkey has been disabled via the <a href="Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> command, it will be listed as OFF or PART (&quot;PART&quot; means that only some of the hotkey's <a href="Hotkey.htm#variant">variants</a> are disabled).</p>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.16+]:</span> If any of a hotkey's variants have a non-zero <a href="_InputLevel.htm">#InputLevel</a>, the level (or minimum and maximum levels) are displayed.</p>
<p>If any of a hotkey's subroutines are currently running, the total number of threads is displayed for that hotkey.</p>
<p>Finally, the type of hotkey is also displayed, which is one of the following:</p>
<p>reg: The hotkey is implemented via the operating system's RegisterHotkey() function.<br>
  reg(no): Same as above except that this hotkey is inactive (due to being unsupported, disabled, or <a href="Suspend.htm">suspended</a>).<br>
  k-hook: The hotkey is implemented via the <a href="_InstallKeybdHook.htm">keyboard hook</a>.<br>
  m-hook: The hotkey is implemented via the <a href="_InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse hook</a>.<br>
  2-hooks: The hotkey requires both the hooks mentioned above.<br>
  joypoll: The hotkey is implemented by polling the joystick at regular intervals.</p>
