<h1>SoundSet</h1>

<p>Changes various settings of a sound device (master mute, master volume, etc.)</p>

<pre class="Syntax">SoundSet, NewSetting [, ComponentType, ControlType, DeviceNumber]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>NewSetting</dt>
  <dd><p>Percentage number between -100 and 100 inclusive (it can be a floating point number). If the number begins with a plus or minus sign, the <strong>current setting </strong> will be adjusted up or down by the indicated amount. Otherwise, the setting will be set explicitly to the level indicated by <em>NewSetting</em>.</p>
      <p>For <em>ControlTypes</em> with only two possible settings -- namely ONOFF, MUTE, MONO, LOUDNESS, STEREOENH, and BASSBOOST -- any positive number will turn on the setting and a zero will turn it off. However, if the number begins with a plus or minus sign, the  setting  will be toggled (set to the opposite of its current state).</p></dd>

  <dt>ComponentType</dt>
  <dd><p>If omitted or blank, it defaults to the word MASTER. Otherwise, it can be one of the following words: MASTER (synonymous with SPEAKERS), DIGITAL, LINE, MICROPHONE, SYNTH, CD, TELEPHONE, PCSPEAKER, WAVE, AUX, ANALOG, HEADPHONES, or N/A. If the sound device lacks the specified <em>ComponentType</em>, ErrorLevel will indicate the problem.</p>
      <p>The component labeled Auxiliary in some mixers might be accessible as ANALOG rather than AUX.</p>
    <p>If a device has more than one instance of <em>ComponentType</em> (two of type LINE, for example), usually the first contains the playback settings and the second contains the recording settings. To access an instance other than the first, append a colon and a number to this parameter. For example: Analog:2 is the second instance of the analog component.</p></dd>

  <dt>ControlType</dt>
  <dd><p>If omitted or blank, it defaults to VOLUME. Otherwise, it can be one of the following words: VOLUME (or VOL), ONOFF, MUTE, MONO, LOUDNESS, STEREOENH, BASSBOOST, PAN, QSOUNDPAN, BASS, TREBLE, EQUALIZER, or the number of a valid control type (see <a href="#Ex">soundcard analysis script</a>). If the specified <em>ComponentType</em> lacks the specified <em>ControlType</em>, ErrorLevel will indicate the problem.</p></dd>

  <dt>DeviceNumber</dt>
  <dd><p>If this parameter is omitted, it defaults to 1 (the first sound device), which is usually the system's default device for recording and playback. Specify a number higher than 1 to operate upon a different sound device.</p></dd>

</dl>
<h3>ErrorLevel</h3>
<p>This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 0 if the command succeeded. Otherwise, it is set to one of the following phrases:</p>
<table class="info" style="width:436px">
  <tr>
    <td width="426">Invalid Control Type or Component Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can't Open Specified Mixer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mixer Doesn't Support This Component Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mixer Doesn't Have That Many of That Component Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Component Doesn't Support This Control Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can't Get Current Setting</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can't Change Setting</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>On Windows Vista or later, SoundSet and SoundGet affect only the script itself (this may be resolved in a future version). There are at least two ways to work around this:</p>
<p>1) In the properties dialog for the file &quot;AutoHotkey.exe&quot; (or a <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">compiled script</a>), change the compatibility setting to &quot;Windows XP&quot;.</p>
<p>2) Have the script send volume-control keystrokes to change the master volume for the entire system. For example:</p>
<pre>Send {Volume_Up}  <em>; Raise the master volume by 1 interval (typically 5%).</em>
Send {Volume_Down 3}  <em>; Lower the master volume by 3 intervals.</em>
Send {Volume_Mute}  <em>; Mute/unmute the master volume.</em></pre>
<p>To discover the capabilities of the sound devices (mixers) installed on the system -- such as the available component types and control types -- run the <a href="#Ex">soundcard analysis script</a>.</p>
<p>When SoundSet changes the volume of a component, all of that component's channels (e.g. left and right) are set to the same level. In other words, any off-center &quot;balance&quot; that may have been set previously is lost.</p>
<p>Use <a href="SoundGet.htm">SoundGet</a> to retrieve the current value of a setting.</p>
