<h1>SysGet</h1>

<p>Retrieves screen resolution, multi-monitor info, dimensions of system objects, and other system properties.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">SysGet, OutputVar, Sub-command [, Param3]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the variable in which to store the result.</p></dd>

  <dt>Sub-command</dt>
  <dd>See list below.
    </dd>

  <dt>Param3</dt>
  <dd><p>This parameter is omitted except where noted below.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Sub-commands</h3>
<p><strong>MonitorCount</strong>: Retrieves the total number of monitors. Unlike SM_CMONITORS mentioned in the table below, <em>MonitorCount</em> includes all monitors, even those not being used as part of the desktop.</p>
<p><strong>MonitorPrimary</strong>: Retrieves the number of the primary monitor, which will be 1 in a single-monitor system.</p>
<p><strong>Monitor [, N]</strong>: Retrieves the bounding coordinates of monitor number <strong>N</strong> (if <strong>N</strong> is omitted, the primary monitor is used). The information is stored in four variables whose names all start with <em>OutputVar</em>. If <strong>N</strong> is too high or there is a problem retrieving the info, the variables are all made blank. For example:</p>
<pre>SysGet, Mon2, Monitor, 2
MsgBox, Left: %Mon2Left% -- Top: %Mon2Top% -- Right: %Mon2Right% -- Bottom %Mon2Bottom%.</pre>
<p>Within a <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a>, to create a set of variables that is global instead of local, <a href="../Functions.htm#Global">declare</a> Mon2 as a global variable prior to using this command (the converse is true for <a href="../Functions.htm#AssumeGlobal">assume-global</a> functions). However, it is often also necessary to declare each variable in the set, due to a <a href="../Functions.htm#ArrayConfusion">common source of confusion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>MonitorWorkArea [, N]</strong>: Same as the above except the area is reduced to exclude the area occupied by the taskbar and other registered desktop toolbars.</p>
<p><strong>MonitorName [, N]</strong>: The operating system's name for monitor number <strong>N</strong> (if <strong>N</strong> is omitted, the primary monitor is used).</p>
<p><strong>(Numeric)</strong>: Specify for <em>Sub-command</em> one of the numbers from the table below to retrieve the corresponding value. The following example would store the number of mouse buttons in a variable named &quot;MouseButtonCount&quot;: <code>SysGet, MouseButtonCount, 43</code>.</p>
