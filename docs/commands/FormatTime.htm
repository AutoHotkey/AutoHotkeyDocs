<h1>FormatTime</h1>

<p>Transforms a <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> timestamp into the specified date/time format.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">FormatTime, OutputVar [, <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a>, Format]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the variable in which to store the result.</p></dd>

  <dt>YYYYMMDD...</dt>
  <dd><p>Leave this parameter blank to use the current local date and time. Otherwise, specify all or the leading part of a timestamp in the <a href="FileSetTime.htm#YYYYMMDD">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</a> format. If the date and/or time portion of the timestamp is invalid -- such as February 29th of a non-leap year -- the date and/or time will be omitted from <em>OutputVar</em>. Although only years between 1601 and 9999 are supported, a formatted time can still be produced for earlier years as long as the time portion is valid.</p></dd>

  <dt>Format</dt>
  <dd><p>If omitted, it defaults to the time followed by the long date, both of which will be formatted according to the current user's locale. For example: 4:55 PM Saturday, November 27, 2004</p>
      <p>Otherwise, specify one or more of the date-time formats below, along with any literal spaces and punctuation in between (commas do not need to be escaped; they can be used normally). In the following example, note that M must be capitalized: M/d/yyyy h:mm tt</p></dd>

<h3>Additional Options</h3>
<p>The following options can appear inside the <em>YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</em> parameter immediately after the timestamp (if there is no timestamp, they may be used alone). In the following example, note the lack of commas between the last four items:</p>
<pre>FormatTime, OutputVar, 20040228 LSys D1 D4</pre>
<p><strong>R</strong>: Reverse. Have the date come before the time (meaningful only when <em>Format</em> is blank).</p>
<p><strong>Ln</strong>: If this option is <em>not</em> present, the current user's locale is used to format the string. To use the system's locale instead, specify LSys. To use a specific locale, specify the letter L followed by a hexadecimal or decimal locale identifier (LCID). For information on how to construct an LCID, search <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</a> for the following phrase: Locale Identifiers</p>
<p><strong>Dn</strong>: Date options. Specify for <strong>n</strong> one of the following numbers:<br>
  0: Force the default options to be used. This also causes the short date to be in effect. <br>
  1: Use short date (meaningful only when <em>Format</em> is blank; not compatible with 2 and 8).<br>
  2: Use long date (meaningful only when <em>Format</em> is blank; not compatible with 1 and 8).<br>
  4: Use alternate calendar (if any).<br>
  8: Use Year-Month format (meaningful only when <em>Format</em> is blank; not compatible with 1 and 2).<br>
  0x10: Add marks for left-to-right reading order layout.<br>
  0x20: Add marks for right-to-left reading order layout.<br>
  0x80000000: Do not obey any overrides the user may have in effect for the system's default date format. <br>
0x40000000: Use the system ANSI code page for string translation instead of the locale's code page.</p>
<p><strong>Tn</strong>: Time options. Specify for <strong>n</strong> one of the following numbers:<br>
  0: Force the default options to be used. This also causes minutes and seconds to be shown.<br>
  1: Omit minutes and seconds.<br>
  2: Omit seconds. <br>
  4: Omit time marker (e.g. AM/PM).<br>
  8: Always use 24-hour time rather than 12-hour time.<br>
  12: Combination of the above two.<br>
  0x80000000: Do not obey any overrides the user may have in effect for the system's default time format. <br>
  0x40000000: Use the system ANSI code page for string translation instead of the locale's code page.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Dn and Tn may be repeated to put more than one option into effect, such as this example: FormatTime, OutputVar, 20040228 D2 D4 T1 T8</p>
<h3 id="Remarks">Remarks</h3>
<p>Letters and numbers that you want to be transcribed literally from <em>Format</em> into <em>OutputVar</em> should be enclosed in single quotes as in this example: 'Date:' MM/dd/yy 'Time:' hh:mm:ss tt</p>
<p>By contrast, non-alphanumeric characters such as spaces, tabs, linefeeds (`n), slashes, colons, commas, and other punctuation do not need to be enclosed in single quotes. The exception to this is the single quote character itself: to produce it literally, use four consecutive single quotes (''''), or just two if the quote is already inside an outer pair of quotes.</p>
<p>If <em>Format</em> contains date and time elements together, they must not be intermixed. In other words, the string should be dividable into two halves: a time half and a date half. For example, a format string consisting of &quot;hh yyyy mm&quot; would not produce the expected result because it has a date element in between two time elements.</p>
<p> When <em>Format</em> contains a numeric day of the month (either d or dd) followed by the full month name (MMMM), the genitive form of the month name is used (if the language has a genitive form).</p>
<p>If <em>Format</em> contains more than 2000 characters, <em>OutputVar</em> will be made blank.</p>
<p>On a related note, addition and subtraction of dates and times can be performed with <a href="DateAdd.htm">DateAdd</a> and <a href="DateDiff.htm">DateDiff</a>.</p>
