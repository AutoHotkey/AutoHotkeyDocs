<h1>Random</h1>

<p>Generates a pseudo-random number.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">Random, OutputVar [, Min, Max]
Random, , NewSeed</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the variable in which to store the result. The format of stored floating point numbers is determined by <a href="SetFormat.htm">SetFormat</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>Min</dt>
  <dd>The smallest number that can be generated, which can be negative, floating point, or an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. If omitted, the
      smallest number will be 0. The lowest allowed value is -2147483648 for integers, but floating point numbers  have no restrictions.</dd>

  <dt>Max</dt>
  <dd><p>The largest number that can be generated, which can be negative, floating point, or an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. If omitted, the largest number will be 2147483647 (which is also the largest allowed integer value -- but floating point numbers have no restrictions).</p></dd>

  <dt>NewSeed</dt>
  <dd><p>This mode reseeds the random number generator with <em>NewSeed</em> (which can be an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>). This affects all subsequently generated random numbers. <em>NewSeed</em> should be an integer between 0 and 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF). Reseeding can improve the quality/security of generated random numbers, especially when <em>NewSeed</em> is a genuine random number rather than one of lesser quality such as a pseudo-random number. Generally, reseeding does not need to be done more than once.</p>
      <p>If reseeding is never done by the script, the seed starts off as the low-order 32-bits of the 64-bit value that is the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601. This value travels from 0 to 4294967295 every ~7.2 minutes.</p></dd>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>This command yields a pseudo-randomly generated number, which is a number
  that simulates a true random number but is really a number based on a complicated
  formula to make determination/guessing of the next number extremely difficult.</p>
<p>All numbers within the specified range have approximately the same probability of being generated (however, see &quot;known limitations&quot; below).</p>
<p>If either <em>Min</em> or <em>Max</em> contains a decimal point, the end result will be a floating point number in the format set by <a href="SetFormat.htm">SetFormat</a>. Otherwise, the result will be an integer.</p>
<p>Known limitations for floating point: 1) only about 4,294,967,296 distinct numbers can be generated for any particular range, so all other numbers in the range will never be generated; 2) occasionally a result can be slightly greater than the specified <em>Max</em> (this is caused in part by the imprecision inherent in floating point numbers).</p>

<h3>Comments based on the original source</h3>
<P>This function uses the Mersenne Twister random number generator, MT19937, written
  by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto, Shawn Cokus, Matthe Bellew and Isaku
  Wada.</P>
<P>The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers. It was
  designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators. The period,
  2<SUP>19937</SUP>-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions, are
  far greater. The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and division,
  and it benefits from caches and pipelines. For more information see the inventors'
  web page at www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/emt.html</P>
