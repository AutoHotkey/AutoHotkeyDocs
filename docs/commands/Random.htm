<h1>Random</h1>

<p>Generates a pseudo-random number.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">N := <span class="func">Random</span>(<span class="optional">Min, Max</span>)</pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Min</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Float</a></p>
    <p>The smallest number that can be generated, which can be negative or floating point. If omitted, the smallest number will be 0. The lowest allowed value is -2147483648 for integers, but floating point numbers  have no restrictions.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>Max</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Float</a></p>
    <p>The largest number that can be generated, which can be negative or floating point. If omitted, the largest number will be 2147483647 (which is also the largest allowed integer value -- but floating point numbers have no restrictions).</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h2 id="Return_Value">Return Value</h2>
<p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Integer</a> or <a href="../Concepts.htm#numbers">Float</a></p>
<p>This function returns a pseudo-randomly generated number, which is a number that simulates a true random number but is really a number based on a complicated formula to make determination/guessing of the next number extremely difficult.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>All numbers within the specified range have approximately the same probability of being generated (however, see "known limitations" below).</p>
<p>If either <em>Min</em> or <em>Max</em> contains a decimal point, the end result will be a floating point number. Otherwise, the result will be an integer.</p>
<p>Known limitations for floating point: 1) only about 4,294,967,296 distinct numbers can be generated for any particular range, so all other numbers in the range will never be generated; 2) occasionally a result can be slightly greater than the specified <em>Max</em> (this is caused in part by the imprecision inherent in floating point numbers).</p>

<h2 id="Seed">RandomSeed</h2>
<p>Reseeds the random number generator with <em>NewSeed</em>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">RandomSeed</span> NewSeed</pre>
<p>This affects all subsequently generated random numbers. <em>NewSeed</em> should be an integer between 0 and 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF). Reseeding can improve the quality/security of generated random numbers, especially when <em>NewSeed</em> is a genuine random number rather than one of lesser quality such as a pseudo-random number. Generally, reseeding does not need to be done more than once.</p>
<p>If reseeding is never done by the script, the seed starts off as the low-order 32-bits of the 64-bit value that is the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601. This value travels from 0 to 4294967295 every ~7.2 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>
<div class="ex" id="ExBasic">
<p><a class="ex_number" href="#ExBasic"></a> Generates a random integer in the range 1 to 10 and stores it in <var>N</var>.</p>
<pre>N := Random(1, 10)</pre>
</div>

<div class="ex" id="ExFloat">
<p><a class="ex_number" href="#ExFloat"></a> Generates a random floating point number in the range 0.0 to 1.0 and stores it in <var>fraction</var>.</p>
<pre>fraction := Random(0.0, 1.0)</pre>
</div>

<h2 id="Comments_based_on_the_original_source">Comments based on the original source</h2>
<p>This function uses the Mersenne Twister random number generator, MT19937, written
  by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto, Shawn Cokus, Matthe Bellew and Isaku
  Wada.</p>
<p>The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers. It was
  designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators. The period,
  2<sup>19937</sup>-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions, are
  far greater. The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and division,
  and it benefits from caches and pipelines. For more information see the inventors'
  web page at <a href="http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html">www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html</a></p>
