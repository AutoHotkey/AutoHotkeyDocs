<h1>If var [not] in value1,value2,...<br>
If var [not] contains value1,value2,...</h1>

<p>Checks whether a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable's</a> contents match one of the items in a list.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">if <i>Var</i> in <i>MatchList</i>
if <i>Var</i> not in <i>MatchList<br>
</i>if <i>Var</i> contains <i>MatchList</i>
if <i>Var</i> not contains <i>MatchList</i></pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<table class="info">
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%">Var</td>
    <td width="85%">The name of the <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a> whose contents will be checked. For the &quot;in&quot; operator, an exact match with one of the list items is required. For the &quot;contains&quot; operator, a match occurs more easily: whenever <em>Var</em> contains one of the list items as a substring.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MatchList</td>
    <td><p>A comma-separated list of strings, each of which will be compared to the contents of <em>Var</em> for a  match. <strong>Any spaces or tabs around the delimiting commas are significant</strong>, meaning that they are part of the match string. For example, if <em>MatchList</em> is set to <em>ABC , XYZ</em> then <em>Var</em> must contain either ABC with a trailing space or XYZ with a leading space to cause a match.</p>
      <p>Two consecutive commas results in a single literal comma. For example, the following would produce a single literal comma at the end of string1: <em>If Var In string1,,,string2</em>. Similarly, the following list contains only a single item with a literal comma inside it: <em>If Var In single,,item</em>. To include a blank item in the list, make the first character a comma as in this example: <em>If Var In ,string1,string2</em> (when using the &quot;contains&quot; operator, a blank item will always result in a match since the empty string is found in all strings).</p>
      <p>Because the items in <em>MatchList</em> are not treated as individual parameters, the list can be contained entirely within a variable. In fact, all or part of it must be contained in a variable if its length exceeds 16383 since that is the maximum length of any script line. For example, <em>MatchList</em> might consist of %List1%,%List2%,%List3% -- where each of the sublists contains a large list of match phrases.</p>
      <p>Any single item in the list that is longer than 16384 characters will have those extra characters treated as a new list item. Thus, it is usually best to avoid including such items.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>The comparison is always done alphabetically, not numerically. For example, the string &quot;11&quot; would not match the list item &quot;11.0&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;contains&quot; operator is the same as using <a href="IfInString.htm">IfInString/IfNotInString</a> except that multiple search strings are supported (any one of which will cause a match).</p>
<p><a href="StringCaseSense.htm"><em>&quot;StringCaseSense</em></a><em> On</em>&quot; can be used to make the comparison case sensitive.</p>
<p>If <em>MatchList</em> is long, it can be broken up into several shorter lines by means of a <a href="../Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation section</a>, which might improve readability and maintainability.</p>
<p><strong>The operators &quot;between&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, and &quot;contains&quot; are not supported in <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expressions</a>.</strong></p>
