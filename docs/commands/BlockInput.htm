<h1>BlockInput</h1>

<p>Disables or enables the user's ability to interact with the computer via keyboard and mouse.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">BlockInput, Mode</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd><p><strong><u>Mode 1</u></strong>: One of the following words:</p>
      <p><strong>On</strong>: The user is prevented from interacting with the computer (mouse and keyboard input has no effect).</p>
      <p><strong>Off</strong>: Input is re-enabled.</p>
      <p><strong><u>Mode 2</u></strong>: This mode operates independently of the other two. For example, <code>BlockInput On</code> will continue to block input until <code>BlockInput Off</code> is used, even if one of the below is also in effect.</p>
      <p><strong>Send</strong>: The user's keyboard and mouse input is ignored while a <a href="Send.htm">Send</a> or <a href="Send.htm">SendRaw</a> is in progress (the traditional <a href="SendMode.htm">SendEvent mode</a> only). This prevents the user's keystrokes from disrupting the flow of simulated keystrokes. When the Send finishes, input is re-enabled (unless still blocked by a previous use of <code>BlockInput On</code>).</p>
      <p><strong>Mouse</strong>: The user's keyboard and mouse input is ignored while a <a href="Click.htm">Click</a>, <a href="MouseMove.htm">MouseMove</a>, <a href="MouseClick.htm">MouseClick</a>, or <a href="MouseClickDrag.htm">MouseClickDrag</a> is in progress (the traditional <a href="SendMode.htm">SendEvent mode</a> only). This prevents the user's mouse movements and clicks from disrupting the simulated mouse events. When the mouse command finishes, input is re-enabled (unless still blocked by a previous use of <code>BlockInput On</code>).</p>
      <p><strong>SendAndMouse</strong>: A combination of the above two modes.</p>
      <p><strong>Default</strong>: Turns off both the <em>Send</em> and the <em>Mouse</em> modes, but does not change the current state of input blocking. For example, if <code>BlockInput On</code> is currently in effect, using <code>BlockInput Default</code> will not turn it off.</p>
      <p id="MouseMove"><u><strong>Mode 3</strong> (requires v1.0.43.11+)</u>: This mode operates independently of the other two. For example, if <code>BlockInput On</code> and <code>BlockInput MouseMove</code> are both in effect, mouse movement will be blocked until both are turned off.</p>
      <p><strong>MouseMove</strong>: The mouse cursor will not move in response to the user's physical movement of the mouse (DirectInput applications are a possible exception). When a script first uses this command, the <a href="_InstallMouseHook.htm">mouse hook</a> is installed (if it is not already). In addition, the script becomes <a href="_Persistent.htm">persistent</a>, meaning that <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> should be used to terminate it. The mouse hook will stay installed until the next use of the <a href="Suspend.htm">Suspend</a> or <a href="Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> command, at which time it is removed if not required by any hotkeys or hotstrings (see <a href="_Hotstring.htm">#Hotstring NoMouse</a>).</p>
      <p><strong>MouseMoveOff</strong>: Allows the user to move the mouse cursor.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <code>BlockInput On</code> might have no effect if UAC is enabled and the script has not been run as administrator. For more information, refer to the <a href="../FAQ.htm#uac">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>In preference to BlockInput, it is often better to use <code><a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode Input</a></code> or <code><a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode Play</a></code> so that keystrokes and mouse clicks become uninterruptible. This is because unlike BlockInput, those modes do not discard what the user types during the send; instead, those keystrokes are buffered and sent afterward. Avoiding BlockInput also avoids the need to work around sticking keys as described in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>If BlockInput becomes active while the user is holding down keys, it might cause those keys to become &quot;stuck down&quot;. This can be avoided by waiting for the keys to be released prior to turning BlockInput on, as in this example:</p>
<pre>^!p::
KeyWait Control  <em>; Wait for the key to be released.  Use one KeyWait for each of the hotkey's modifiers.</em>
KeyWait Alt
BlockInput On
<em>; ... send keystrokes and mouse clicks ...</em>
BlockInput Off
return</pre>
<p>Input blocking is automatically and momentarily disabled whenever an ALT event is sent (then re-enabled afterward).</p>
<p>When BlockInput is in effect, user input is blocked but AutoHotkey can simulate keystrokes and mouse clicks. However, pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del will re-enable input due to a Windows API feature.</p>
<p>Certain types of <a href="_UseHook.htm">hook hotkeys</a> can still be triggered when BlockInput is on. Examples include <code>MButton</code> (mouse hook) and <code>LWin &amp; Space</code> (keyboard hook with explicit prefix rather than modifiers <code>$#</code>).</p>
<p>Input is automatically re-enabled when the script closes.</p>
