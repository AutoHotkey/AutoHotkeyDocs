<h1>FileRead</h1>

<p>Reads a file's contents into a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a>.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">FileRead, OutputVar, Filename</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a> in which to store the retrieved data. <em>OutputVar</em> will be made blank if a problem occurs such as the file being &quot;in use&quot; or not existing (in which case <a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1). It will also be made blank if <em>Filename</em> is an empty file (in which case ErrorLevel is set to 0).</p></dd>

  <dt>Filename</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the file to read, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">%A_WorkingDir%</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
      <p><strong>Options</strong>: Zero or more of the following strings may be also be present immediately before the name of the file. Separate each option from the next with a single space or tab. For example: <code>*t *m5000 C:\Log Files\200601.txt</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>*c</strong>: Load a <a href="../misc/Clipboard.htm#ClipboardAll">ClipboardAll</a> file or other binary data. All other options are ignored when <strong>*c</strong> is present.</p>
    <p><strong>*m1024</strong>: If this option is omitted, the entire file is loaded unless there is insufficient memory, in which case an error message is shown and the thread exits (but <a href="Try.htm">Try</a> can be used to avoid this). Otherwise, replace 1024 with a decimal or hexadecimal number of bytes. If the file is larger than this, only its leading part is loaded. Note: This might result in the last line ending in a naked carriage return (`r) rather than `r`n.</p>    
    <p><strong>*t</strong>: Replaces any/all occurrences of carriage return &amp; linefeed (`r`n) with linefeed (`n). However, this translation reduces performance and is usually not necessary. For example, text containing `r`n is already in the right format to be added to a <a href="StringReplace.htm">Gui Edit control</a>. Similarly, <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> detects the presence of `r`n when it opens a new file; it knows to write each `r`n as-is rather than translating it to `r`r`n. Finally, the following <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loop</a> will work correctly regardless of whether each line ends in `r`n or just `n: <code>Loop, parse, MyFileContents, `n, `r</code>.</p>
    <p><strong>*Pnnn</strong>: <span class="ver">[AHK_L 42+]:</span> Overrides the default encoding set by <a href="FileEncoding.htm">FileEncoding</a>, where <em>nnn</em> must be a numeric <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd317756.aspx">code page identifier</a>.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>ErrorLevel</h3>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span> This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 0 if the load was successful. It is set to 1 if a problem occurred such as: 1) file does not exist; 2) file is locked or inaccessible; 3) the system lacks sufficient memory to load the file.</p>
<p><a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> is set to the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function.</p>

<h3 id="Binary">Reading Binary Data</h3>
<p>Depending on the file, parameters and default settings, FileRead may interpret the file data as text and convert it to the <a href="../Compat.htm#Format">native encoding</a> used by the script. This is likely to cause problems if the file contains binary data, except in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the <span class="Syntax">*C</span> option is present, all code page and end-of-line translations are unconditionally bypassed.</li>
  <li>If the <span class="Syntax">*P<i>nnn</i></span> option is present and <i>nnn</i> corresponds to the native string encoding, no code page translation occurrs.</li>
  <li>If the current <a href="FileEncoding.htm">file encoding</a> setting corresponds to the native string encoding, no code page translation occurrs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that once the data has been read into <em>OutputVar</em>, only the text before the first binary zero (if any are present) will be &quot;seen&quot; by most AutoHotkey commands and functions. However, the entire contents are still present and can be accessed by advanced methods such as <a href="NumGet.htm">NumGet()</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen()</a> and <a href="../objects/File.htm#RawRead">File.RawRead()</a> or <a href="../objects/File.htm#ReadNum">File.Read<i>Num</i>()</a> may be used to read binary data without first reading the entire file into memory.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>When the goal is to load all or a large part of a file into memory, FileRead performs much better than using a <a href="LoopReadFile.htm">file-reading loop</a>.</p>
<p>A file greater than 1 GB in size will cause <a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> to be set to 1 and <em>OutputVar</em> to be made blank unless the <strong>*m</strong> option is present, in which case the leading part of the file is loaded.</p>
<p>FileRead does not obey <a href="_MaxMem.htm">#MaxMem</a>. If there is concern about using too much memory, check the file size beforehand with <a href="FileGetSize.htm">FileGetSize</a>.</p>
<p><a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen()</a> provides more advanced functionality than FileRead, such as reading or writing data at a specific location in the file without reading the entire file into memory. See <a href="../objects/File.htm">File Object</a> for a list of functions.</p>
