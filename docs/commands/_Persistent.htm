<h1>#Persistent</h1>

<p>Keeps a script permanently running (that is, until the user closes it or <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> is encountered).</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">#Persistent</span></pre>
<p>If this directive is present anywhere in the script, that script will stay running after the auto-execute section (top part of the script) completes and all other <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> have exited. This is usually unnecessary because the script <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">automatically becomes persistent</a> when the program detects that it has some way of launching new threads, such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a> or <a href="../objects/Gui.htm">GUI</a>.</p>
<p>Some cases where this directive might be needed (if there are no running threads or hotkeys, timers, etc.) include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scripts which use <a href="CallbackCreate.htm">CallbackCreate</a> and <a href="DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> to respond to events, since those functions don't make the script persistent.</li>
  <li>Scripts which <a href="ComObjCreate.htm">create</a> or <a href="ComObjActive.htm">retrieve</a> COM objects and use <a href="ComObjConnect.htm">ComObjConnect</a> to respond to the object's events.</li>
</ul>
<p>If this directive is added to an existing script, you might want to change some or all occurrences of <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> to be <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a>. This is because <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> will not terminate a persistent script; it  terminates only the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a>.</p>
