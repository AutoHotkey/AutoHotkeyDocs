<h1>Exit</h1>

<p>Exits the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a> or (if the script is not <a href="_Persistent.htm">persistent</a> and contains no hotkeys) the entire script.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">Exit [, ExitCode]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<table class="info">
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%">ExitCode</td>
    <td width="85%">An integer between -2147483648 and 2147483647 (can be an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>) that is returned to its caller when the script exits. This code is accessible to any program that spawned the script, such as another script (via RunWait) or a batch (.bat) file. If omitted, ExitCode defaults to zero. Zero is traditionally used to indicate success. Note: Windows 95 may be limited in how large  ExitCode can be.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>If the script has no hotkeys, isn't <a href="_Persistent.htm">persistent</a>, and hasn't requested the Num/Scroll/CapsLock key(s) to be kept AlwaysOn or AlwaysOff, it will terminate immediately when Exit is encountered (except if it has an <a href="OnExit.htm">OnExit</a> subroutine).</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Exit command terminates the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a>. In other words, the stack of subroutines called directly or indirectly by a <a href="Menu.htm">menu</a>, <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>, or <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> subroutine will all be returned from as though a <a href="Return.htm">Return</a> were immediately encountered in each. If used directly inside such a subroutine -- rather than in one of the subroutines called indirectly by it -- Exit is equivalent to <a href="Return.htm">Return</a>.</p>
<p>Use <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> to completely terminate a script that is <a href="_Persistent.htm">persistent</a> or contains hotkeys.</p>

Sub2:
