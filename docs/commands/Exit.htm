<h1>Exit</h1>

<p>Exits the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a>.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">Exit [, ExitCode]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>ExitCode</dt>
  <dd><p>An integer between -2147483648 and 2147483647 that is returned to its caller when the script exits. This code is accessible to any program that spawned the script, such as another script (via RunWait) or a batch (.bat) file. If omitted, ExitCode defaults to zero. Zero is traditionally used to indicate success. Note: Windows 95 may be limited in how large ExitCode can be.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>If the script is not <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">persistent</a> and this is the last thread, the entire script exits.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the Exit command terminates the <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">current thread</a>. In other words, the stack of subroutines called directly or indirectly by a <a href="Menu.htm">menu</a>, <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>, or <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a> subroutine will all be returned from as though a <a href="Return.htm">Return</a> were immediately encountered in each. If used directly inside such a subroutine -- rather than in one of the subroutines called indirectly by it -- Exit is equivalent to <a href="Return.htm">Return</a>.</p>
<p>Use <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> to completely terminate a script that is <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">persistent</a>.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

MsgBox, This msgbox will never happen because of the EXIT.
return

Sub2:
Exit  <em>; Terminate this subroutine as well as the calling subroutine.</em></pre>
