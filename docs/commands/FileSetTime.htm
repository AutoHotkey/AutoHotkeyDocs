<h1>FileSetTime</h1>

<p>Changes the  datetime stamp of one or more files or folders. Wildcards are supported.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">FileSetTime</span> <span class="optional">YYYYMMDDHH24MISS, FilePattern, WhichTime, Mode</span></pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</dt>
  <dd><p>If blank or omitted, it defaults to the current time. Otherwise, specify the time to use for the operation (see Remarks for the format).
  Years prior to 1601 are not supported.</p></dd>

  <dt>FilePattern</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of a single file or folder, or a wildcard pattern such as C:\Temp\*.tmp. <em>FilePattern</em> is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
    <p>If omitted, the current file of the innermost enclosing <a href="LoopFile.htm">File-Loop</a> will be used instead.</p></dd>

  <dt>WhichTime</dt>
  <dd>Which timestamp to set:<br>
      M = Modification time (this is the default if the parameter is blank or omitted)<br>
      C = Creation time<br>
      A = Last access time</dd>

  <dt>Mode</dt>
  <dd><p>Zero or more of the following letters:</p>
    <p><code>D</code>: Include directories (folders).<br>
    <code>F</code>: Include files. If both F and D are omitted, files are included but not folders.<br>
    <code>R</code>: Subfolders are recursed into so that files and folders contained therein are operated upon if they match <em>FilePattern</em>. All subfolders will be recursed into, not just those whose names match <em>FilePattern</em>. If R is omitted, files and folders in subfolders are not included.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If <em>FilePattern</em> is a single folder rather than a wildcard pattern, it will always be operated upon regardless of this setting.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>ErrorLevel</h3>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to the number of files that <u>failed</u> to be changed or 0 otherwise. If the specified timestamp is invalid, or <em>FilePattern</em> resolves to a blank value, ErrorLevel is set to 1.</p>
<p>If files were found, <a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> is set to 0 (zero) or the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function immediately after the last failure. Otherwise A_LastError contains an error code that might indicate why no files were found.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p><strong>Known limitation:</strong> Files and folders with a complete path name longer than 259 characters are skipped over, and may or may not be counted in ErrorLevel. Such files are rare because normally, the operating system does not allow their creation.</p>
<p>A file's last access time might not be as precise on FAT16 &amp; FAT32 volumes as it is on NTFS volumes.</p>
<p id="YYYYMMDD">The elements of the YYYYMMDDHH24MISS format are:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <td>YYYY</td>
    <td>The 4-digit year</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MM</td>
    <td>The 2-digit month (01-12)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DD</td>
    <td>The 2-digit day of the month (01-31)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HH24</td>
    <td>The 2-digit hour in 24-hour format (00-23). For example, 09 is 9am and 21 is 9pm.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MI</td>
    <td>The 2-digit minutes (00-59)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SS</td>
    <td>The 2-digit seconds (00-59)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If only a partial string is given for YYYYMMDDHH24MISS (e.g. 200403), any remaining element that has been omitted will be supplied with the following default values:</p>
<p>MM: Month 01<br>
  DD: Day 01<br>
  HH24: Hour 00<br>
  MI: Minute 00<br>
SS: Second 00</p>
<p>The built-in variable <a href="../Variables.htm#Now">A_Now</a> contains the current local time in the above format. Similarly, <a href="../Variables.htm#NowUTC">A_NowUTC</a> contains the current Coordinated Universal Time.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Date-time values can be compared, added to, or subtracted from via <a href="DateAdd.htm">DateAdd</a> and <a href="DateDiff.htm">DateDiff</a>. Also, it is best to not use greater-than or less-than to compare times unless they are both the same string length. This is because they would be compared as numbers; for example, 20040201 is always numerically less (but chronologically greater) than 200401010533. So instead use <a href="DateDiff.htm">DateDiff</a> to find out whether the amount of time between them is positive or negative.</p>

<pre class="NoIndent"><em>; Set the modification time to the current time for all matching files:</em>
FileSetTime "", "C:\temp\*.txt"

<em>; Set the modification date (time will be midnight):</em>
FileSetTime 20040122, "C:\My Documents\test.doc"

<em>; Set the creation date. The time will be set to 4:55pm:</em>
FileSetTime 200401221655, "C:\My Documents\test.doc", "C"

<em>; Change the mod-date of all files that match a pattern.
