<h1>FileSetTime</h1>

<p>Changes the  datetime stamp of one or more files or folders. Wildcards are supported.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">FileSetTime [, YYYYMMDDHH24MISS, FilePattern, WhichTime, OperateOnFolders?, Recurse?]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>YYYYMMDDHH24MISS</dt>
  <dd><p>If blank or omitted, it defaults to the current time. Otherwise, specify the time to use for the operation (see Remarks for the format).
  Years prior to 1601 are not supported.</p></dd>

  <dt>FilePattern</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of a single file or folder, or a wildcard pattern such as C:\Temp\*.tmp. <em>FilePattern</em> is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">%A_WorkingDir%</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
    <p>If omitted, the current file of the innermost enclosing <a href="LoopFile.htm">File-Loop</a> will be used instead.</p></dd>

  <dt>WhichTime</dt>
  <dd>Which timestamp to set:<br>
      M = Modification time (this is the default if the parameter is blank or omitted)<br>
      C = Creation time<br>
      A = Last access time </dd>

  <dt>OperateOnFolders?</dt>
  <dd><p>0 (default) Folders are not operated upon (only files). <br>
1 All files and folders that match the wildcard pattern are operated upon.<br>
2 Only folders  are operated upon (no files). </p>
      <p>Note: If FilePattern is a single folder rather than a wildcard pattern, it will always be operated upon regardless of this setting.</p></dd>

  <dt>Recurse?</dt>
  <dd><p>0 (default) Subfolders are not recursed into.<br>
  1 Subfolders are recursed into so that files and folders contained therein are operated upon if they match <em>FilePattern</em>. All subfolders will be recursed into, not just those whose names match <em>FilePattern</em>. However, files and folders with a complete path name longer than 259 characters are skipped over as though they do not exist. Such files are rare because normally, the operating system does not allow their creation.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>ErrorLevel</h3>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span> This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to the number of files that <u>failed</u> to be changed or 0 otherwise. If the specified timestamp is invalid, or <em>FilePattern</em> resolves to a blank value, ErrorLevel is set to 1.</p>
<p>If files were found, <a href="../Variables.htm#LastError">A_LastError</a> is set to 0 (zero) or the result of the operating system's GetLastError() function immediately after the last failure. Otherwise A_LastError contains an error code that might indicate why no files were found.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>Under Windows 95/98/ME, changing the timestamp of folders is not supported. Attempts to do so are ignored.</p>
<p>A file's last access time might not be as precise on FAT16 &amp; FAT32 volumes as it is on NTFS volumes.</p>
<p><a name="YYYYMMDD"></a>The elements of the YYYYMMDDHH24MISS format are:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <td width="46">YYYY</td>
    <td width="538">The 4-digit year</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MM</td>
    <td>The 2-digit month (01-12) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DD</td>
    <td>The 2-digit day of the month (01-31)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HH24</td>
    <td>The 2-digit hour in 24-hour format (00-23). For example, 09 is 9am and 21 is 9pm.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MI</td>
    <td>The 2-digit minutes (00-59)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SS</td>
    <td>The 2-digit seconds (00-59)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If only a partial string is given for YYYYMMDDHH24MISS (e.g. 200403), any remaining element that has been omitted will be supplied with the following default values:</p>
<p>MM: Month 01<br>
  DD: Day 01<br>
  HH24: Hour 00<br>
  MI: Minute 00<br>
SS: Second 00</p>
<p>The built-in variable <a href="../Variables.htm#Now">A_Now</a> contains the current local time in the above format. Similarly, <a href="../Variables.htm#NowUTC">A_NowUTC</a> contains the current Coordinated Universal Time.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Date-time values can be compared, added to, or subtracted from via <a href="DateAdd.htm">DateAdd</a> and <a href="DateDiff.htm">DateDiff</a>. Also, it is best to not use greater-than or less-than to compare times unless they are both the same string length. This is because they would be compared as numbers; for example, 20040201 is always numerically less (but chronologically greater) than 200401010533. So instead use <a href="DateDiff.htm">DateDiff</a> to find out whether the amount of time between them is positive or negative.</p>

<pre class="NoIndent"><em>; Set the modification time to the current time for all matching files:</em>
FileSetTime, , C:\temp\*.txt

<em>; Set the modification date (time will be midnight):</em>
