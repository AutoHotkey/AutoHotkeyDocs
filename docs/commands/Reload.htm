<h1>Reload</h1>

<p>Replaces the currently running instance of the script with a new one.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Reload</span></pre>
<p>This command is useful for scripts that are frequently changed. By assigning a hotkey to this command, you can easily restart the script after saving your changes in an editor.</p>
<p>By default, the script can also be reloaded via its <a href="../Program.htm#tray-icon">tray icon</a> or <a href="../Program.htm#main-window">main window</a>.</p>
<p>Any <a href="../Scripts.htm#cmd">command-line parameters</a> passed to the original script are not passed to the new instance. To pass such parameters, do not use Reload. Instead, use <a href="Run.htm">Run</a> in conjunction with <a href="../Variables.htm#AhkPath">A_AhkPath</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#ScriptFullPath">A_ScriptFullPath</a> (and <a href="../Variables.htm#IsCompiled">A_IsCompiled</a> if the script is ever used in compiled form). Also, include the string <code>/restart</code> as the first parameter (i.e. after the name of the executable), which tells the program to use the same behavior as Reload. See also: <a href="../Scripts.htm#cmd">command line switches and syntax</a>.</p>
<p>When the script restarts, it is launched in its original working directory (the one that was in effect when it was first launched). In other words, <a href="SetWorkingDir.htm">SetWorkingDir</a> will not change the working directory that will be used for the new instance.</p>
<p>If the script cannot be reloaded -- perhaps because it has a syntax error -- the original instance of the script will continue running. Therefore, the reload command should be followed by whatever actions you want taken in the event of a failure (such as a <a href="Return.htm">return</a> to exit the current subroutine). To have the original instance detect the failure, follow this example:</p>
<pre>Reload
Sleep 1000 <em>; If successful, the reload will close this instance during the Sleep, so the line below will never be reached.</em>
MsgBox, 4,, The script could not be reloaded. Would you like to open it for editing?
IfMsgBox, Yes, Edit
return</pre>
<p>AutoHotkey relies on the title of the script's <a href="../Program.htm#main-window">main window</a> to identify other running instances of the script.</p>
