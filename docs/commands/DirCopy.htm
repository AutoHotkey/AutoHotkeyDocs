<h1>DirCopy</h1>

<p>Copies a folder along with all its sub-folders and files (similar to xcopy).</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">DirCopy</span> Source, Dest <span class="optional">, Flag</span></pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Source</dt>
  <dd><p>Name of the source directory (with no trailing backslash), which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. For example: C:\My Folder</p></dd>

  <dt>Dest</dt>
  <dd><p>Name of the destination directory (with no trailing baskslash), which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. For example: C:\Copy of My Folder</p></dd>

  <dt>Flag</dt>
  <dd><p>(optional) this flag determines whether to overwrite files 
        if they already exist:</p>
      <p><strong>0</strong> (default): Do not overwrite existing files. The operation will fail and have no effect if <em>Dest</em> already exists as a file or directory.</p>
      <p><strong>1</strong>: Overwrite existing files. However, any files or subfolders inside <em>Dest</em> that do not have a counterpart in <em>Source</em> will not be deleted.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>ErrorLevel</h3>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1 if there was a problem or 0 otherwise. However, if the source directory contains any saved webpages consisting of a <em>PageName.htm</em> file and a corresponding directory named <em>PageName_files</em>, an error may be indicated even when the copy is successful.</p>
<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>If the destination directory structure doesn't exist it will be created if possible.</p>
<p>Since the operation will recursively copy a folder along with all its subfolders and files, the result of copying a folder to a destination somewhere inside itself is undefined. To work around this, first copy it to a destination outside itself, then use <a href="DirMove.htm">DirMove</a> to move that copy to the desired location.</p>
<p>DirCopy copies a single folder. To instead copy the contents of a folder (all its files and subfolders), see the examples section of <a href="FileCopy.htm">FileCopy</a>.</p>

    return

DirCopy SourceFolder, TargetFolder "\" SourceFolderName
