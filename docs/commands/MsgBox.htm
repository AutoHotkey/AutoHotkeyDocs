<h1>MsgBox</h1>

<p>Displays the specified text in a small window containing one or more buttons (such as Yes and No).</p>

<pre class="Syntax">MsgBox, Text
MsgBox [, Options, Title, Text, Timeout]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Text</dt>
  <dd><p>If all the parameters are omitted, the MsgBox will display the text &quot;Press OK to continue.&quot;. Otherwise, this parameter is the text displayed inside the message box to instruct the user what to do, or to present information.</p>
    <p><a href="_EscapeChar.htm">Escape sequences</a> can be used to denote special characters. For example, `n indicates a linefeed character, which ends the current line and begins a new one. Thus, using text1`n`ntext2 would create a blank line between text1 and text2.</p>
    <p>If <em>Text</em> is long, it can be broken up into several shorter lines by means of a <a href="../Scripts.htm#continuation">continuation section</a>, which might improve readability and maintainability.</p></dd>

  <dt>Options</dt>
  <dd><p>Indicates the type of message box and the possible button combinations. If blank or omitted, it defaults to 0. See the table below for allowed values.</p>
    <p>This parameter must be either a literal number or (in v1.1.06+) a forced expression such as <code>% Options</code>. Any other non-blank value will not be recognized as this parameter, but instead as part of <em>Text</em> in the single-parameter mode.</p></dd>

  <dt>Title</dt>
  <dd><p>The title of the message box window. If omitted or blank, it defaults to the name of the script (without path).</p></dd>

  <dt id="Timeout">Timeout</dt>
  <dd><p>(optional) Timeout in seconds, which can contain a decimal point but is not an expression by default. In v1.1.06+, this can be a forced expression such as <code>% mins*60</code>.</p>
    <p>If this value exceeds 2147483 (24.8 days), it will be set to 2147483. After the timeout has elapsed the message box will be automatically closed and the <a href="IfMsgBox.htm">IfMsgBox</a> command will see the value TIMEOUT.</p>
      <p>Known limitation: If the MsgBox contains only an OK button, <a href="IfMsgBox.htm">IfMsgBox</a> will think that the OK button was pressed if the MsgBox times out while its own <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> is interrupted by another.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>The <em>Options</em> parameter can be a combination (sum) of one or more of the following values.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>The table above is used by adding up the values you wish to be present in the MsgBox. For example, to specify a Yes/No box with the default button being No instead of Yes, the <em>Options</em> value would be 256+4 (260). In hex, it would be 0x100+0x4 (0x104).</p>
<p>MsgBox has smart comma handling, so it is usually not necessary to <a href="_EscapeChar.htm">escape</a> commas in the <em>Text</em> parameter.</p>
<p>To determine which button the user pressed in the most recent MsgBox, use the <a href="IfMsgBox.htm">IfMsgBox</a> command. For example:</p>
<pre>MsgBox, 4,, Would you like to continue? (press Yes or No)
IfMsgBox Yes
    MsgBox You pressed Yes.
else
    MsgBox You pressed No.</pre>
<p>The names of the buttons can be customized by following <a href="../scripts/MsgBoxButtonNames.htm">this example</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Pressing Control-C while a MsgBox window is active will copy its text to the clipboard. This applies to all MsgBoxes, not just those produced by AutoHotkey.</p>
<p><strong>Using MsgBox with GUI windows</strong>: A GUI window may display a <em>modal</em> MsgBox by means of <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">Gui +OwnDialogs</a>. A <em>modal</em> MsgBox prevents the user from interacting with the GUI window until the MsgBox is dismissed. In such a case, it is not necessary to specify the System Modal or Task Modal options from the table above.</p>
<p>When <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">Gui +OwnDialogs</a> is <em>not</em> in effect, the Task Modal option (8192) can be used to disable all the script's windows until the user dismisses the MsgBox.</p>
<p><strong>The Help button</strong>: When the Help button option (83) is present in <em>Options</em>, pressing the Help button will have no effect unless both of the following are true:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The MsgBox is owned by a GUI window by means of <a href="Gui.htm#OwnDialogs">Gui +OwnDialogs</a>.</li>
  <li>The script is monitoring the WM_HELP message (0x53). For example: <code><a href="OnMessage.htm">OnMessage(0x53, &quot;WM_HELP&quot;)</a></code>. When the WM_HELP() function is called, it may guide the user by means such as showing another window or MsgBox.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Close button (in MsgBox's title bar)</strong>: Since the MsgBox window is a built-in feature of the operating system, its <strong>X</strong> button is enabled only when certain buttons are present. If there is only an OK button, clicking the <strong>X</strong> button is the same as pressing OK. Otherwise, the X button is disabled unless there is a Cancel button, in which case clicking the <strong>X</strong> is the same as pressing Cancel.</p>

<em>; By preceding any parameter with &quot;% &quot;, it becomes an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. In the following example,
