<h1>ControlGetFocus</h1>

<p>Retrieves which control of the target window has input focus, if any.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">ControlGetFocus</span>, OutputVar <span class="optional">, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the variable in which to store the identifier of the control, which consists of its classname followed by its sequence number within its parent window, e.g. Button12.</p></dd>

  <dt>WinTitle</dt>
  <dd><p>A window title or other criteria identifying the target window. See <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm">WinTitle</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>WinText</dt>
  <dd><p>If present, this parameter must be a substring from a single text element of the target window (as revealed by the included Window Spy utility). Hidden text elements are detected if <a href="DetectHiddenText.htm">DetectHiddenText</a> is ON.</p></dd>

  <dt>ExcludeTitle</dt>
  <dd><p>Windows whose titles include this value will not be considered.</p></dd>

  <dt>ExcludeText</dt>
  <dd><p>Windows whose text include this value will not be considered.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span>: This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 0 if the control with input focus was successfully retrieved. Otherwise (e.g. the target window doesn't exist or none of its controls have input focus) it will be set to 1.</p>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>The control retrieved by this command is the one that has keyboard focus, that is, the one that would receive keystrokes if the user were to type any.</p>
<p>The target window must be active to have a focused control. If the window is not active, <em>OutputVar</em> will be made blank.</p>
<p>Prior to <span class="ver">[v1.1.19.03]</span>, if ControlGetFocus was executed repeatedly at a high frequency (i.e. every 500 ms or faster), it usually disrupted the user's ability to double-click. This has been fixed.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>
