<h1>ControlGetFocus</h1>

<p>Retrieves which control of the target window has input focus, if any.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">ClassNN := <span class="func">ControlGetFocus</span>(<span class="optional">WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span>)</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>WinTitle</dt>
  <dd><p>A window title or other criteria identifying the target window. See <a href="../misc/WinTitle.htm">WinTitle</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>WinText</dt>
  <dd><p>If present, this parameter must be a substring from a single text element of the target window (as revealed by the included Window Spy utility). Hidden text elements are detected if <a href="DetectHiddenText.htm">DetectHiddenText</a> is ON.</p></dd>

  <dt>ExcludeTitle</dt>
  <dd><p>Windows whose titles include this value will not be considered.</p></dd>

  <dt>ExcludeText</dt>
  <dd><p>Windows whose text include this value will not be considered.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Return Value</h3>
<p>Returns the ClassNN of the control; that is, the control's classname followed by its sequence number within its parent window, e.g. Button12.</p>
<p>If there was a problem or none of the target window's controls has focus, the return value is blank.</p>

<h3>ErrorLevel</h3>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 1 if there was a problem determining the focus or 0 otherwise. An ErrorLevel of 1 typically indicates that the window does not exist.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>The control retrieved by this function is the one that has keyboard focus, that is, the one that would receive keystrokes if the user were to type any.</p>
<p>The target window must be active to have a focused control, but even the active window may lack a focused control. If the target window was found but none of its controls have focus, ErrorLevel is set to 0 and the return value is blank.</p>
<p>Window titles and text are case sensitive. Hidden windows are not detected unless <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> has been turned on.</p>
