<h1>OnMessage()</h1>

<p>Specifies a <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a> to call automatically when the script receives the specified message.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">OnMessage(MsgNumber [, &quot;FunctionName&quot;, MaxThreads])</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>MsgNumber</dt>
  <dd><p>The number of the message to monitor or query, which should be between 0 and 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFF). If you do not wish to monitor a <a href="../misc/SendMessageList.htm">system message</a> (that is, one below 0x400), it is best to choose a number greater than 4096 (0x1000) to the extent you have a choice. This reduces the chance of interfering with messages used internally by current and future versions of AutoHotkey.</p></dd>

  <dt>FunctionName</dt>
  <dd><p>A <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a>'s name, which must be enclosed in quotes if it is a literal string. This function will be called automatically when the script receives <em>MsgNumber</em>. Omit this parameter and the next one to retrieve the name of the function currently monitoring <em>MsgNumber</em> (blank if none). Specify an empty string (&quot;&quot;) or an empty variable to turn off the monitoring of <em>MsgNumber</em>.</p></dd>

  <dt>MaxThreads<br>
    <span class="ver">[v1.0.47+]</span></dt>
  <dd><p><a name="MaxThreads"></a>This integer is normally omitted, in which case the monitor function is limited to one <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> at a time. This is usually best because otherwise, the script would process messages out of chronological order whenever the monitor function interrupts itself. Therefore, as an alternative to <em>MaxThreads</em>, consider using <em>Critical </em>as described <a href="#Critical">below</a>.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
<p>If <em>FunctionName</em> and <em>MaxThreads</em> are omitted, it returns the name of the function currently monitoring <em>MsgNumber</em> (blank if none). However, no changes are made.</p>
<p>If <em>FunctionName</em> is explicitly blank (e.g. &quot;&quot;), it returns the name of the function currently monitoring <em>MsgNumber</em> (blank if none), then disables the monitoring of <em>MsgNumber</em>.</p>
<p>If <em>FunctionName</em> is non-blank: If <em>MsgNumber</em> is already being monitored, it returns the name of that function then puts the new function into effect. Otherwise, it assigns <em>FunctionName</em> to monitor <em>MsgNumber</em> then returns the same <em>FunctionName. </em>In either case, a blank value is returned upon failure. Failure occurs when <em>FunctionName</em>: 1) does not exist (perhaps due to missing quotes around <em>FunctionName</em>); 2) accepts more than four parameters; or 3) has any <a href="../Functions.htm#ByRef">ByRef</a> or <a href="../Functions.htm#optional">optional</a> parameters. It will also fail if the script attempts to monitor a new message when there are already 500 messages being monitored.</p>
<h3>The Function's Parameters</h3>
<p>A <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a> assigned to monitor one or more messages can accept up to four parameters:</p>
<pre>MyMessageMonitor(wParam, lParam, msg, hwnd)
{
    ... body of function...
}</pre>
<p>Although the names you give the parameters do not matter, the following information is sequentially assigned to them:</p>
<p>Parameter #1: The message's WPARAM value, which is an integer between 0 and 4294967295.<br>
Parameter #2: The message's LPARAM value, which is an integer between 0 and 4294967295.<br>
Parameter #3: The message number, which is useful in cases where a function monitors more than one message.<br>
Parameter #4: The HWND (unique ID) of the window or control to which the message was sent. The HWND can be used with <a href="../LastFoundWindow.htm#id">ahk_id</a>.</p>
<p>You can omit one or more parameters from the end of the list if the corresponding information is not needed. For example, a function defined as <em>MyMsgMonitor(wParam, lParam)</em> would receive only the first two parameters, and one defined as <em>MyMsgMonitor()</em> would receive none of them.</p>
<p>If an incoming WPARAM or LPARAM is intended to be a signed integer, any negative numbers can be revealed by following this example:</p>
<pre>if wParam &gt; 0x7FFFFFFF
    wParam := -(~wParam) - 1</pre>
<h3>Additional Information Available to the Function</h3>
<p>In addition to the parameters received above, the function may also consult the values in the following built-in variables:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../Variables.htm#Gui">A_Gui</a>: Blank unless the message was sent to a GUI window or control, in which case A_Gui is the <a href="Gui.htm#MultiWin">Gui Window number</a> (this window is also set as the function's <a href="Gui.htm#DefaultWin">default GUI window</a>).</li>
  <li>    <a href="../Variables.htm#GuiControl">A_GuiControl</a>: Blank unless the message was sent to a GUI control, in which case it contains the control's variable name or other value as described at <a href="../Variables.htm#GuiControl">A_GuiControl</a>. Some controls never receive certain types of messages. For example, when the user clicks a <a href="GuiControls.htm#Text">text control</a>, the operating system sends WM_LBUTTONDOWN to the parent window rather than the control; consequently, A_GuiControl is blank.</li>
  <li> <a href="../Variables.htm#GuiX">A_GuiX</a> and <a href="../Variables.htm#GuiX">A_GuiY</a>: Both contain -2147483648 if the incoming message was sent via <a href="PostMessage.htm">SendMessage</a>. If it was sent via <a href="PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>, they contain the mouse cursor's coordinates (relative to the screen) at the time the message was posted.</li>
  <li>    <a href="../Variables.htm#EventInfo">A_EventInfo</a>: Contains 0 if the message was sent via SendMessage. If sent via PostMessage, it contains the <a href="../Variables.htm#TickCount">tick-count time</a> the message was posted.</li>
</ul>
<p>A monitor function's <a href="../LastFoundWindow.htm">last found window</a> starts off as the parent window to which the message was sent (even if it was sent to a control). If the window is hidden but not a GUI window (such as the script's main window), turn on <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a> before using it. For example:</p>
<pre>DetectHiddenWindows On
MsgParentWindow := WinExist()  <em>; This stores the unique ID of the window to which the message was sent.</em></pre>
<h3>What the Function Should <em>Return</em></h3>
<p>If a monitor function uses <a href="Return.htm">Return</a> without any parameters, or it specifies a blank value such as &quot;&quot; (or it never uses Return at all), the incoming message goes on to be processed normally when the function finishes. The same thing happens if the function <a href="Exit.htm">Exits</a> or causes a runtime error such as <a href="Run.htm">running</a> a nonexistent file. By contrast, returning an integer between -2147483648 and 4294967295 causes that number to be sent immediately as a reply; that is, the program does not process the message any further. For example, a function monitoring WM_LBUTTONDOWN (0x201) may return an integer to prevent the target window from being notified that a mouse click has occurred. In many cases (such as a message arriving via <a href="PostMessage.htm">PostMessage</a>), it does not matter which integer is returned; but if in doubt, 0 is usually safest.</p>
<h3 id="Remarks">General Remarks</h3>
<p>Unlike a normal function-call, the arrival of a monitored message calls the function as a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>. Because of this, the function starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a> and <a href="DetectHiddenWindows.htm">DetectHiddenWindows</a>. These defaults can be changed in the <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>.</p>
<p>Messages sent to a control (rather than being posted) are not monitored because the system routes them directly to the control behind the scenes. This is seldom an issue for system-generated messages because most of them are posted.</p>
<p>Any script with active message monitors is automatically <a href="../Scripts.htm#persistent">persistent</a>, which means that it will not exit until <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> is used.</p>
<p><a name="Critical"></a>If a message arrives while its function is still running due to a previous arrival of the same message, the function will not be called again (except if <a href="#MaxThreads">MaxThreads</a> is greater than 1); instead, the message will be treated as unmonitored. If this is undesirable, a message greater than or equal to 0x312 can be buffered until its function completes by specifying <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> as the first line of the function. Alternatively, <a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt</a> can achieve the same thing as long as it lasts long enough for the function to finish. By contrast, a message less than 0x312 cannot be buffered by Critical or Thread Interrupt (however, in v1.0.46+, Critical may help because it checks messages <a href="Critical.htm#Interval">less often</a>, which gives the function more time to finish). The only way to guarantee that no such messages are missed is to ensure the function finishes in under 6 milliseconds (though this limit can be raised via <a href="Critical.htm#Interval"><em>Critical 30</em></a>). One way to do this is to have it queue up a future thread by <a href="PostMessage.htm">posting</a> to its own script a monitored message number higher than 0x312. That message's function should use <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> as its first line to ensure that its messages are buffered.</p>
<p>If a monitored message that is numerically less than 0x312 arrives while the script is absolutely uninterruptible -- such as while a <a href="Menu.htm">menu</a> is displayed, a <a href="SetKeyDelay.htm">KeyDelay</a>/<a href="SetMouseDelay.htm">MouseDelay</a> is in progress, or the clipboard is being <a href="_ClipboardTimeout.htm">opened</a> -- the message's function will not be called and the message will be treated as unmonitored.  By contrast, a monitored message of 0x312 or higher will be buffered during  these uninterruptible periods; that is, its function will be called when the script becomes interruptible.</p>
<p>If a monitored message numerically less than 0x312 arrives while the script is uninterruptible merely due to the settings of <a href="Thread.htm">Thread Interrupt</a> or <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a>, the current thread will be interrupted so that the function can be called. By contrast, a monitored message of 0x312 or higher will be buffered until the thread finishes or becomes interruptible.</p>
<p>The <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">priority</a> of OnMessage threads is always 0. Consequently, no messages are monitored or buffered when the current thread's priority is higher than 0.</p>
<p>Caution should be used when monitoring system messages (those below 0x400). For example, if a monitor function does not finish quickly, the response to the message might take longer than the system expects, which might cause side-effects. Unwanted behavior may also occur if a monitor function returns an integer to suppress further processing of a message, but the system expected different processing or a different response.</p>
<p>When the script is displaying a system dialog such as <a href="MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>, any message posted to a control is not monitored. For example, if the script is displaying a MsgBox and the user clicks a button in a GUI window, the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message is sent directly to the button without calling the monitor function.</p>
<p>Although an external program may post messages directly to a script's thread via PostThreadMessage() or other API call, this is not recommended because the messages would be lost if the script is displaying a system window such as a <a href="MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a>. Instead, it is usually best to post or send the messages to the script's main window or one of its GUI windows.</p>
