<h1>SetWinDelay</h1>

<p>Sets the delay that will occur after each windowing command, such as <a href="WinActivate.htm">WinActivate</a>.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SetWinDelay</span>, Delay</pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>Delay</dt>
  <dd><p>Time in milliseconds, which can be an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. Use -1 for no delay at all and 0 for the smallest possible delay. If unset, the default delay is 100.</p></dd>

</dl>

<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>A short delay (sleep) is done automatically after every windowing command except <a href="WinActive.htm">WinActive() / IfWinActive</a> and <a href="WinExist.htm">WinExist() / IfWinExist</a>. This is done to improve the reliability of scripts because a window sometimes needs a period of &quot;rest&quot; after being created,  activated, minimized, etc. so that it has a chance to update itself and respond to the next command that the script may attempt to send to it.</p>
<p>Although a delay of -1 (no delay at all) is allowed, it is recommended that at least 0 be used, to increase confidence that the script will run correctly even when the CPU is under load.</p>
<p>A delay of 0 internally executes a Sleep(0), which yields the remainder of the script's timeslice to any other process that may need it. If there is none, Sleep(0) will not sleep at all.</p>
<p>If the CPU is slow or under load, or if window animation is enabled, higher delay values may be needed.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_WinDelay</strong> contains the current setting.</p>
<p>Every newly launched <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (such as a <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed</a> subroutine) starts off fresh with the default setting for this command. That default may be changed by using this command in the auto-execute section (top part of the script).</p>
