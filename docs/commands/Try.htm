<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>The <em>try</em> statement is usually followed by a <a href="Block.htm">block</a> - one or more statements (typically functions or expressions) enclosed in braces. If only a single statement is to be executed, it can be placed on the same line as <em>try</em> or on the next line, and the braces can be omitted. To specify code that executes only when <em>try</em> catches an error, use one or more <a href="Catch.htm">catch</a> statements.</p>
<p>If <em>try</em> is used without <em>catch</em> or <em>finally</em>, it is equivalent to having <code>catch Error</code> with an empty block.</p>
<p>A value can be thrown by the <a href="Throw.htm">throw</a> statement or by the program when a runtime error occurs. When a value is thrown from within a try block or a function called by one, the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there is a <a href="Catch.htm">catch</a> statement which matches the class of the thrown value, execution is transferred into it.</li>
  <li>If there is no matching catch statement but there is a <a href="Finally.htm">finally</a> statement, it is executed, but once it finishes the value is automatically thrown again.</li>
  <li>If there is no matching catch statement or finally statement, the value is automatically thrown again.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <em>catch</em> is used, it can optionally be followed by <em>else</em>. If present, <em>else</em> is executed if nothing was thrown during execution of the try block. Exceptions thrown by the <em>else</em> statement are not handled by its associated try statement, but may be handled by an enclosing try statement. <em>Finally</em> can also be present, but must be placed after <em>else</em>, and is always executed last.</p>
<p>The <a href="Block.htm#otb">One True Brace (OTB) style</a> may optionally be used with the <em>try</em> statement. For example:</p>
<pre>try {
    ...
} catch Error as err {
    ...
} else {
    ...
} finally {
    ...
}</pre>
