<h1>Sleep</h1>

<p>Waits the specified amount of time before continuing.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Sleep</span> DelayInMilliseconds</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Delay</dt>
  <dd><p>The amount of time to pause (in milliseconds) between 0 and 2147483647 (24 days).</p></dd>

</dl>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>Due to the granularity of the OS's time-keeping system, <em>Delay</em> is typically rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10 or 15.6 milliseconds (depending on the type of hardware and drivers installed). For example, a delay between 1 and 10 (inclusive) is equivalent to 10 or 15.6 on most Windows 2000/XP systems. To achieve a shorter delay, see <a href="#ShorterSleep">Examples</a>.</p>
<p>The actual delay time might wind up being longer than what was requested if the CPU is under load. This is because the OS gives each needy process a slice of CPU time (typically 20 milliseconds) before giving another timeslice to the script.</p>
<p>A delay of 0 yields the remainder of the script's current timeslice to any other processes that need it (as long as they are not significantly lower in <a href="Process.htm#Priority">priority</a> than the script). Thus, a delay of 0 produces an actual delay between 0 and 20ms (or more), depending on the number of needy processes (if there are no needy processes, there will be no delay at all). However, a <em>Delay</em> of 0 should always wind up being shorter than any longer <em>Delay</em> would have been.</p>
<p>While sleeping, new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">threads</a> can be launched via <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkey</a>, <a href="../objects/Menu.htm">custom menu item</a>, or <a href="SetTimer.htm">timer</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sleep -1</strong>: A delay of -1 does not sleep but instead makes the script immediately check its message queue. This can be used to force any pending <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">interruptions</a> to occur at a specific place rather than somewhere more random. See <a href="Critical.htm">Critical</a> for more details.</p>
