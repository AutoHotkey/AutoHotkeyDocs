<h1>OnExit</h1>

<p>Specifies a <a href="../Functions.htm">function</a> to run automatically when the script exits.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">OnExit</span> Func <span class="optional">, AddRemove</span></pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<dl>

  <dt>Func</dt>
  <dd><p>A function name or <a href="../objects/Functor.htm">function object</a> to call when the script is exiting. The function can optionally define parameters as shown below. If an OnExit function returns a non-zero integer, the script does not exit. Otherwise, the script exits after all registered functions are called.</p>
  <pre class="Syntax"><i>MyFunction</i>(<a href="#ExitReason">ExitReason</a>, <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitCode</a>)</pre></dd>
  
  <dt>AddRemove</dt>
  <dd><p>One of the following values:<br>
  <strong>1</strong> (the default): Call the function after any previously registered functions.<br>
  <strong>-1</strong>: Call the function before any previously registered functions.<br>
  <strong>0</strong>: Do not call the function.</p>
  </dd>

</dl>

<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>Any number of OnExit functions can be registered. An OnExit function usually should not call ExitApp; if it does, the script terminates immediately.</p>
<p>OnExit functions are called when the script exits by any means (except when it is killed by something like &quot;End Task&quot;). It is also called whenever <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> and <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> ask a previous instance to terminate.</p>
<p>A script can detect and optionally abort a system shutdown or logoff via <code><a href="OnMessage.htm#shutdown">OnMessage(0x11, &quot;WM_QUERYENDSESSION&quot;)</a></code>.</p>
<p>The OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> does not obey <a href="_MaxThreads.htm">#MaxThreads</a> (it will always launch when needed). In addition, while it is running, it cannot be interrupted by any <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, including <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>, <a href="../objects/Menu.htm">custom menu items</a>, and <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed subroutines</a>. However, it will be interrupted (and the script will terminate) if the user chooses Exit from the tray menu or main menu, or the script is asked to terminate as a result of <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> or <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a>. Because of this, an OnExit function should be designed to finish quickly unless the user is aware of what it is doing.</p>
<p>If the OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> encounters a failure condition such as a runtime error, the script will terminate.</p>
<p>If the OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> was launched due to an <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> or <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> function that specified an exit code, that exit code is used unless an OnExit function returns true (preventing exit) or calls ExitApp.</p>
<p>Whenever an exit attempt is made, each OnExit function starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed in the <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>.</p>
<p>If an OnExit function declares parameters, its first parameter is one of the following words:</p>
<table class="info" id="ExitReason">
  <tr id="logoff">
    <td>Logoff</td>
    <td>The user is logging off.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Shutdown</td>
    <td>The system is being shut down or restarted, such as by the <a href="Shutdown.htm">Shutdown</a> function.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Close</td>
    <td>The script was sent a WM_CLOSE or WM_QUIT message, had a critical error, or is being closed in some other way. Although all of these are unusual, WM_CLOSE might be caused by <a href="WinClose.htm">WinClose</a> having been used on the script's main window. To prevent this, dismiss the main window with <code>Send "!{F4}"</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Error</td>
    <td>A runtime error occurred in a script that is not <a href="_Persistent.htm">persistent</a>. An example of a runtime error is <a href="Run.htm">Run/RunWait</a> being unable to launch the specified program or document.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Menu</td>
    <td>The user selected Exit from the main window's menu or from the standard tray menu.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exit</td>
    <td>The <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> or <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> function was used (includes <a href="../objects/Menu.htm">custom menu items</a>).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reload</td>
    <td>The script is being reloaded via the <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> function or menu item.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Single</td>
    <td>The script is being replaced by a new instance of itself as a result of <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The following example uses <a href="_Persistent.htm">#Persistent</a> to prevent the script from exiting automatically. After running the script, right click the tray icon and click <em>Exit</em> to test the OnExit function. Then click "Yes" to terminate the script or "No" to keep it running.</p>
<pre class="NoIndent">#Persistent

{
    if ExitReason != "Logoff" and ExitReason != "Shutdown"
