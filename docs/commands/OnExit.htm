<h1>OnExit</h1>

<p>Specifies a <a href="Gosub.htm">subroutine</a> to run  automatically when the script exits.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">OnExit [, Label]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%">Label</td>
    <td width="85%">If omitted, the script is returned to its normal exit behavior. Otherwise, specify the name of the <a href="../misc/Labels.htm">label</a> whose contents will be executed (as a new <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>) when the script exits by any means.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Since the specified subroutine is called instead of terminating the script, that subroutine must use the <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> command if termination is desired. Alternatively (as in the Examples section below), the OnExit subroutine might display a <a href="MsgBox.htm">MsgBox</a> to prompt the user for confirmation -- and only if the user presses YES would the script execute ExitApp to close itself.</p>
<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p>The OnExit subroutine is called when the script exits by any means (except when it is killed by something like &quot;End Task&quot;). It is also called whenever the <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a> and <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> commands ask a previous instance to terminate.</p>
<p>A script can detect and optionally abort a system shutdown or logoff via <code><a href="OnMessage.htm#shutdown">OnMessage(0x11, &quot;WM_QUERYENDSESSION&quot;)</a></code>.</p>
<p>The OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> does not obey <a href="_MaxThreads.htm">#MaxThreads</a> (it will always launch when needed). In addition, while it is running, it cannot be interrupted by any <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>, including <a href="../Hotkeys.htm">hotkeys</a>, <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu items</a>, and <a href="SetTimer.htm">timed subroutines</a>. However, it will be interrupted (and the script will terminate) if the user chooses Exit from the tray menu or main menu, or the script is asked to terminate as a result of <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> or <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a>. Because of this, the OnExit subroutine should be designed to finish quickly unless the user is aware of what it is doing.</p>
<p>If the OnExit <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> encounters a failure condition such as a runtime error, the script will terminate. This prevents a flawed OnExit subroutine from making a script impossible to terminate.</p>
<p>If the OnExit subroutine was launched due to an <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> or <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> command that specified an exit code, that code is ignored and no longer available. A new exit code can be specified by the OnExit subroutine if/when it calls <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a>.</p>
<p>Whenever the OnExit subroutine is called by an exit attempt, it starts off fresh with the default values for settings such as <a href="SendMode.htm">SendMode</a>. These defaults can be changed in the <a href="../Scripts.htm#auto">auto-execute section</a>.</p>
<p>The built-in variable <strong>A_ExitReason </strong>is blank unless the OnExit subroutine  is currently running or has been called at least once by a prior exit attempt. If not blank, it is one of the following words:</p>
<table class="info">
  <tr>
    <td>Logoff</td>
    <td><a name="logoff"></a>The user is logging off.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Shutdown</td>
    <td>The system is being shut down or restarted, such as by the <a href="Shutdown.htm">Shutdown</a> command. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Close</td>
    <td>The script was sent a WM_CLOSE or WM_QUIT message, had a critical error, or is being closed in some other way. Although all of these are unusual, WM_CLOSE might be caused by <a href="WinClose.htm">WinClose</a> having been used on the script's main window. To prevent this, dismiss the main window with <code>Send, !{F4}</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Error</td>
    <td>A runtime error  occurred in a script that has no hotkeys and that is not <a href="_Persistent.htm">persistent</a>. An example of a runtime error is <a href="Run.htm">Run/RunWait</a> being unable to launch the specified program or document.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Menu</td>
    <td>The user selected Exit from the main window's menu or from the standard tray menu.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exit</td>
    <td>The <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> or <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a> command was used (includes <a href="Menu.htm">custom menu items</a>). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reload</td>
    <td>The script is being reloaded via the <a href="Reload.htm">Reload</a> command or menu item.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Single</td>
    <td>The script is being replaced by a new instance of itself as a result of <a href="_SingleInstance.htm">#SingleInstance</a>. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
