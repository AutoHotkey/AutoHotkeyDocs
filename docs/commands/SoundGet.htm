<h1>SoundGet</h1>

<p>Retrieves various settings from a sound device (master mute, master volume, etc.)</p>
<p class="red">Functionality is limited on Windows Vista and later; see <a href="#Vista">Remarks</a>.</p>

<pre class="Syntax">SoundGet, OutputVar [, ComponentType, ControlType, DeviceNumber]</pre>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<table class="info">
  <tr> 
    <td width="15%">OutputVar</td>
    <td width="85%">The name of the variable in which to store the retrieved setting, which is either a floating point number between 0 and 100 (inclusive) or the word ON or OFF (used only for <em>ControlTypes</em> ONOFF, MUTE, MONO, LOUDNESS, STEREOENH, and BASSBOOST). The variable will be made blank if there was a problem retrieving the setting. The format of the floating point number, such as its decimal places, is determined by <a href="SetFormat.htm">SetFormat</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ComponentType</td>
    <td><p>If omitted or blank, it defaults to the word MASTER. Otherwise, it can be one of the following words: MASTER (synonymous with  SPEAKERS), DIGITAL, LINE, MICROPHONE, SYNTH, CD, TELEPHONE, PCSPEAKER, WAVE, AUX, ANALOG, HEADPHONES, or N/A. If the sound device lacks the specified <em>ComponentType</em>, ErrorLevel will indicate the problem.</p>
      <p>The component labeled Auxiliary in some mixers might be accessible as ANALOG rather than AUX.</p>
    <p>If a device has more than one instance of <em>ComponentType</em> (two of type LINE, for example), usually the first contains the playback settings and the second contains the recording settings. To access an instance other than the first, append a colon and a number to this parameter. For example: <code>Analog:2</code> is the second instance of the analog component.</p>    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ControlType</td>
    <td>If omitted or blank, it defaults to VOLUME. Otherwise, it can be one of the following words: VOLUME (or VOL), ONOFF, MUTE, MONO, LOUDNESS, STEREOENH, BASSBOOST, PAN, QSOUNDPAN, BASS, TREBLE, EQUALIZER, or the number of a valid control type (see <a href="SoundSet.htm#Ex">soundcard analysis script</a>). If the specified <em>ComponentType</em> lacks the specified <em>ControlType</em>, ErrorLevel will indicate the problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DeviceNumber</td>
    <td>If this parameter is omitted, it defaults to 1 (the first sound device), which is usually the system's default device for recording and playback. Specify a number higher than 1 to operate upon a different sound device. This parameter can be an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>.</td>
  </tr>

<h3>ErrorLevel</h3>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span> This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 0 if the command succeeded. Otherwise, it is set to one of the following phrases:</p>
<table class="info" style="width:436px">
  <tr>
    <td width="426">Invalid Control Type or Component Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can't Open Specified Mixer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mixer Doesn't Support This Component Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mixer Doesn't Have That Many of That Component Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Component Doesn't Support This Control Type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can't Get Current Setting</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Remarks</h3>
<p id="Vista">On Windows Vista or later, SoundGet retrieves the script's own settings, not those of the system or active window. This may be resolved in a future version. There are two known workarounds:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the new audio API. A library of script functions has been written for this purpose:<br> <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/21984-vista-audio-control-functions/">http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/21984-vista-audio-control-functions/</a></li>
  <li>In the properties dialog for the file &quot;AutoHotkey.exe&quot; (or a <a href="../Scripts.htm#ahk2exe">compiled script</a>), change the compatibility setting to &quot;Windows XP&quot;. This does not restore full functionality, and may have undesired side-effects.</li>
</ol>
<p>To discover the capabilities of the sound devices (mixers) installed on the system -- such as the available component types and control types -- run the <a href="SoundSet.htm#Ex">soundcard analysis  script</a>.</p>
<p>Use <a href="SoundSet.htm">SoundSet</a> to change a setting. </p>
