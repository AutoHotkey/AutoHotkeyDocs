<h1>SoundGet</h1>

<p>Retrieves various settings from a sound device (master mute, master volume, etc.)</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">SoundGet</span>, OutputVar <span class="optional">, ComponentType, ControlType, DeviceNumber</span></pre>
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>OutputVar</dt>
  <dd><p>The name of the variable in which to store the retrieved setting, which is either a floating point number between 0 and 100 (inclusive) or the word ON or OFF (used only for <em>ControlTypes</em> ONOFF, MUTE, MONO, LOUDNESS, STEREOENH, and BASSBOOST). The variable will be made blank if there was a problem retrieving the setting. The format of the floating point number, such as its decimal places, is determined by <a href="SetFormat.htm">SetFormat</a>.</p></dd>

  <dt>ComponentType</dt>
  <dd><p>If omitted or blank, it defaults to the word MASTER. Otherwise, it can be one of the following words: MASTER (synonymous with  SPEAKERS), DIGITAL, LINE, MICROPHONE, SYNTH, CD, TELEPHONE, PCSPEAKER, WAVE, AUX, ANALOG, HEADPHONES, or N/A. If the sound device lacks the specified <em>ComponentType</em>, ErrorLevel will indicate the problem.</p>
      <p>The component labeled Auxiliary in some mixers might be accessible as ANALOG rather than AUX.</p>
    <p>If a device has more than one instance of <em>ComponentType</em> (two of type LINE, for example), usually the first contains the playback settings and the second contains the recording settings. To access an instance other than the first, append a colon and a number to this parameter. For example: <code>Analog:2</code> is the second instance of the analog component.</p></dd>

  <dt>ControlType</dt>
  <dd><p>If omitted or blank, it defaults to VOLUME. Otherwise, it can be one of the following words: VOLUME (or VOL), ONOFF, MUTE, MONO, LOUDNESS, STEREOENH, BASSBOOST, PAN, QSOUNDPAN, BASS, TREBLE, EQUALIZER, or the number of a valid control type (see <a href="SoundSet.htm#Ex">soundcard analysis script</a>). If the specified <em>ComponentType</em> lacks the specified <em>ControlType</em>, ErrorLevel will indicate the problem.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Sound devices usually support only VOLUME (or VOL) and MUTE, although others may be available depending on Windows and the sound device.</p></dd>

  <dt>DeviceNumber</dt>
  <dd><p>A number between 1 and the total number of supported devices. If this parameter is omitted, it defaults to 1 (the first sound device), or on Windows Vista or above, the system's default device for playback. This parameter can be an <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expression</a>. The <a href="SoundSet.htm#Ex">soundcard analysis script</a> may help determine which number to use.</p></dd>

</dl>
<h2>Error Handling</h2>
<p><span class="ver">[v1.1.04+]</span>: This command is able to throw an exception on failure. For more information, see <a href="Catch.htm#RuntimeErrors">Runtime Errors</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../misc/ErrorLevel.htm">ErrorLevel</a> is set to 0 if the command succeeded. Otherwise, it is set to one of the following phrases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Invalid Control Type or Component Type</li>
    <li>Can't Open Specified Mixer</li>
    <li>Mixer Doesn't Support This Component Type</li>
    <li>Mixer Doesn't Have That Many of That Component Type</li>
    <li>Component Doesn't Support This Control Type</li>
    <li>Can't Get Current Setting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remarks</h2>
<p>Support for Windows Vista and later was added in v1.1.10.</p>
<p>To discover the capabilities of the sound devices (mixers) installed on the system -- such as the available component types and control types -- run the <a href="SoundSet.htm#Ex">soundcard analysis script</a>.</p>
