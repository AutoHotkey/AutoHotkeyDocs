<h2 id="syntax-and-usage">Syntax and Usage</h2>
<p>A label identifies a line of code, and can be used as a <a href="../commands/Goto.htm">Goto</a> target or to form a <a href="../commands/Gosub.htm">subroutine</a>.</p>
<pre class="Syntax">LabelName:</pre>
<p>To create a label, write the label name followed by a colon as shown above. Aside from whitespace and comments, no other code can be written on the same line.</p>
<p><strong>Names:</strong> Label names are not case sensitive, and may consist of any characters other than space, tab, comma and the <a href="EscapeChar.htm">escape character</a> (`). However, due to style conventions, it is generally better to use only letters, numbers, and the underscore character (for example: <em>MyListView</em>, <em>Menu_File_Open</em>, and <em>outer_loop</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Each function has its own list of local labels. If a local label has the same name as a global label, the local label takes precedence (and the global label is inaccessible). Local labels cannot be used with the <a href="../commands/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a> or <a href="../commands/Hotstring.htm">Hotstring</a> functions.</p>
<p><strong>Target:</strong> The target of a label is the next line of executable code. Executable code includes functions, assignments, <a href="../Variables.htm#Expressions">expressions</a> and <a href="../commands/Block.htm">blocks</a>, but not directives, labels, hotkeys or hotstrings. In the following example, <code>run_notepad_1</code> and <code>run_notepad_2</code> both point at the <code>Run</code> line:</p>
<pre>run_notepad_1:
run_notepad_2:
    Run "notepad"
    return
</pre>
<p><strong>Execution:</strong> Like directives, labels have no effect when reached during normal execution. In the following example, a message box is shown twice - once during execution of the subroutine by <a href="../commands/Gosub.htm">Gosub</a>, and again after the subroutine returns:</p>
<pre>Gosub Label1

Label1:
MsgBox <a href="../Variables.htm#ThisLabel">A_ThisLabel</a>
return</pre>

<h2 id="subroutines">Subroutines</h2>
<p>A subroutine is a portion of code which can be <em>called</em> to perform a specific task. Execution of a subroutine begins at the target of a label and continues until a <a href="../commands/Return.htm">Return</a> or <a href="../commands/Exit.htm">Exit</a> is encountered. Since the end of a subroutine depends on flow of control, any label can act as both a Goto target and the beginning of a subroutine.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-labels">Dynamic Labels</h2>
<p>Many built-in functions which accept a label name also accept a <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a>, in which case the name stored in the variable is used as the target. However, performance is slightly reduced because the target label must be &quot;looked up&quot; each time rather than only once when the script is first loaded.</p>

<h2 id="named-loops">Named Loops</h2>
<p>A label can also be used to identify a loop for the <a href="../commands/Continue.htm">Continue</a> and <a href="../commands/Break.htm">Break</a> statements. This allows the script to easily continue or break out of any number of nested loops.</p>

<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>
<p><a href="../Functions.htm">Functions</a> can be used in place of labels in a number of cases, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../commands/Hotkey.htm">Hotkey</a></li>
  <li><a href="../objects/Menu.htm#Add">Menu.Add</a></li>
  <li><a href="../commands/SetTimer.htm">SetTimer</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The benefits of functions are that they can use local variables, and in some cases (such as Gui control events) they also accept parameters containing useful information.</p>
