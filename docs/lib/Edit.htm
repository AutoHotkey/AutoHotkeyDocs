<h1>Edit</h1>

<p>Opens the current script for editing in the associated editor.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Edit</span></pre>
<p>The Edit function opens the current script for editing using the associated "edit" verb in the registry (or Notepad if no verb). However, if an editor window appears to have the script already open (based on its window title), that window is activated instead of opening a new instance of the editor.</p>
<p>The default program, script or command line executed by the "edit" verb can be changed via <em>Editor settings</em> in the <a href="../Program.htm#dash">Dash</a>.</p>
<p>This function  has no effect when operating from within a compiled script.</p>
<p>On a related note, AutoHotkey syntax highlighting can be enabled for various editors - see below. In addition, context sensitive help for AutoHotkey functions can be enabled in any editor via <a href="../scripts/index.htm#ContextSensitiveHelp">this example</a>. Finally, your productivity may be improved by using an auto-completion utility like <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=31484">the script by boiler</a> or <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=27882">the script by Helgef</a>, which works in almost any editor. It watches what you type and displays menus and parameter lists, which does some of the typing for you and reminds you of the order of parameters.</p>

<h2 id="Editors">Editors with AutoHotkey Support</h2>
<p>Any text editor can be used to edit an AutoHotkey script, but editors which are (or can be configured to be) more AutoHotkey-aware tend to make reading, editing and testing scripts much easier. AutoHotkey-aware editors may provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting, like what is used in this documentation. With syntax highlighting, words, symbols and segments of code are colour-coded to indicate their meaning. For instance, literal text, comments and variable names are displayed in different colours.</li>
  <li>Auto-complete, which typically offers a list of suggestions when you start typing the name of a known function or variable.</li>
  <li>Calltips may show you what the parameters are for a function while you are writing code to call the function.</li>
  <li><a href="../Scripts.htm#idebug">Interactive debugging</a>, such as to step through the script line by line and inspect variables at each step, or to view and modify variables or objects, beyond what <a href="ListVars.htm">ListVars</a> allows.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>SciTE4AutoHotkey is simple to install, relatively light-weight, and fully supports AutoHotkey v1 and v2 without further configuration.</li>
  <li>VS Code (plus extensions) provides an even higher level of support and a wider range of features, but can be heavy on resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>SciTE4AutoHotkey</b> is a custom version of the text editor known as SciTE. Its features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Auto-complete</li>
  <li>Calltips</li>
  <li>Smart auto-indent</li>
  <li>Code folding</li>
  <li>Interactive debugging</li>
  <li>Running the script by pressing a hotkey</li>

<p><b>Visual Studio Code</b> (VS Code) can be configured with a high level of support for AutoHotkey by installing extensions.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thqby.vscode-autohotkey2-lsp">AutoHotkey2 Language Support</a> provides many features, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Auto-complete</li>
  <li>Calltips</li>
  <li>Smart auto-indent</li>
  <li>Code folding</li>
  <li>Running the script by pressing a hotkey</li>
  <li>Real-time diagnostics (detecting common errors)</li>
  <li>Formatting/tidying code</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>This extension only supports AutoHotkey v2, but can also detect v1 scripts and automatically switch over to a v1 extension if one is installed.</li>
  <li>This extension can also be used with other editors, such as <b>vim</b>, <b>neovim</b> and <b>Sublime Text 4</b>. For details, see <a href="https://github.com/thqby/vscode-autohotkey2-lsp#use-in-other-editors">Use in other editors</a>. However, VS Code likely provides the best experience, with easiest setup.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zero-plusplus.vscode-autohotkey-debug">vscode-autohotkey-debug</a> provides support for interactive debugging of v1 and v2 scripts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Auto-complete</li>
  <li>Code folding</li>
  <li>Running the script by pressing a hotkey</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=88&t=50">Setup Notepad++ for AutoHotkey</a> for instructions.</p>
