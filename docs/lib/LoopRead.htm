<h1>Loop Read</h1>

<p>Retrieves the lines in a text file, one at a time.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Loop Read</span> InputFile <span class="optional">, OutputFile</span></pre>
<h2 id="Parameters">Parameters</h2>
<dl>

  <dt>InputFile</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
    <p>The name of the text file whose contents will be read by the loop, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified. The file's lines may end in carriage return and linefeed (`r`n), just linefeed (`n), or just carriage return (`r).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="OutputFile">OutputFile</dt>
  <dd>
      <p>Type: <a href="../Concepts.htm#strings">String</a></p>
      <p>The name of the file to be kept open for the duration of the loop, which is assumed to be in <a href="../Variables.htm#WorkingDir">A_WorkingDir</a> if an absolute path isn't specified.</p>
      <p>Within the loop's body, use the <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> function without the <em>Filename</em> parameter (i.e. omit it) to append to this special file. Appending to a file in this manner performs better than using <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> in its 2-parameter mode because the file does not need to be closed and re-opened for each operation. Remember to include a linefeed (`n) or carriage return and linefeed (`r`n) after the text, if desired.</p>
      <p>The file is not opened if nothing is ever written to it. This happens if the Loop performs zero iterations or if it never calls <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Options</strong>: The end of line (EOL) translation mode and output file encoding depend on which options are passed in the opening call to <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> (i.e. the first call which omits <em>Filename</em>). Subsequent calls ignore the <em>Options</em> parameter. EOL translation is not performed by default; that is, linefeed (`n) characters are written as-is unless the <code>"`n"</code> option is present.</p>
      <p><strong>Standard Output (stdout)</strong>: Specifying an asterisk (*) for <em>OutputFile</em> sends any text written by <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> to standard output (stdout). Such text can be redirected to a file, piped to another EXE, or captured by <a href="_ErrorStdOut.htm">fancy text editors</a>. However, text sent to stdout will not appear at the command prompt it was launched from. This can be worked around by 1) compiling the script with the <a href="../misc/Ahk2ExeDirectives.htm#ConsoleApp">Ahk2Exe ConsoleApp directive</a>, or 2) piping a script's output to another command or program. See <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>A file-reading loop is useful when you want to operate on each line contained in a text file, one at a time. The file is kept open for the entire operation to avoid having to re-scan each time to find the next line.</p>
<p id="LoopReadLine">The built-in variable <strong>A_LoopReadLine</strong> exists within any file-reading loop. It contains the contents of the current line excluding the carriage return and linefeed (`r`n) that marks the end of the line. If an inner file-reading loop is enclosed by an outer file-reading loop, the innermost loop's file-line will take precedence.</p>
<p>Lines up to 65,534 characters long can be read. If the length of a line exceeds this, its remaining characters will be read during the next loop iteration.</p>
<p><a href="StrSplit.htm">StrSplit</a> or a <a href="LoopParse.htm">parsing loop</a> is often used inside a file-reading loop to parse the contents of each line retrieved from <em>InputFile</em>. For example, if <em>InputFile</em>'s lines are each a series of tab-delimited fields, those fields can individually retrieved as in this example:</p>
<pre>Loop read, "C:\Database Export.txt"
{
    Loop parse, A_LoopReadLine, A_Tab
    {
        MsgBox "Field number " A_Index " is " A_LoopField "."
    }
}</pre>
<p>To load an entire file into a variable, use <a href="FileRead.htm">FileRead</a> because it performs much better than a loop (especially for large files).</p>
<p>To have multiple files open simultaneously, use <a href="FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a>.</p>
<p id="otb">The One True Brace (OTB) style may optionally be used, which allows the open-brace to appear on the same line rather than underneath. For example: <code>Loop Read InputFile, OutputFile {</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="Loop.htm">Loop</a> for information about <a href="Block.htm">Blocks</a>, <a href="Break.htm">Break</a>, <a href="Continue.htm">Continue</a>, and the A_Index variable (which exists in every type of loop).</p>
<p>To control how the file is decoded when no byte order mark is present, use <a href="FileEncoding.htm">FileEncoding</a>.</p>
<p>The loop may optionally be followed by an <a href="Else.htm">Else</a> statement, which is executed if the input file is empty or could not be found. If <em>OutputFile</em> was specified, the special mode of <a href="FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a> described <a href="#OutputFile">above</a> may also be used within the <em>Else</em> statement's body. If there is no <em>Else</em>, an <a href="../objects/Error.htm#OSError">OSError</a> is thrown if the file could not be found.</p>
