<h1>Finally <span class="ver">[v1.1.14+]</span></h1>

<p>Ensures that one or more statements are always executed after a <a href="Try.htm">Try</a> statement finishes.</p>

<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">Finally</span> <i>Statement</i></pre>
<pre class="Syntax" style="line-height: 100%">

<h2 id="Remarks">Remarks</h2>
<p>Every use of <em>Finally</em> must belong to (be associated with) a <a href="Try.htm">Try</a> (or <a href="Catch.htm">Catch</a>) statement above it. A <em>Finally</em> always belongs to the nearest unclaimed <em>Try</em> statement above it unless a <a href="Block.htm">block</a> is used to change that behavior.</p>
<p><em>Try</em> statements behave differently depending on whether <em>Catch</em> or <em>Finally</em> is present. For more information, see <a href="Try.htm">Try</a>.</p>
<p><em>Goto</em>, <em>Break</em>, <em>Continue</em> and <em>Return</em> cannot be used to exit a <em>Finally</em> block, as that would require suppressing any control flow statements within the <em>Try</em> block. For example, if <em>Try</em> uses <code>return 42</code>, the value 42 is returned after the <em>Finally</em> block executes. Attempts to jump out of a <em>Finally</em> block using one of these statements are detected as errors at load time where possible, or at run time otherwise.</p>
<p>Prior to <span class="ver">[v1.1.19.02]</span>, a bug existed which prevented control flow statements within <em>Try</em> from working when <em>Finally</em> was present. <em>Return</em> was erroneously permitted within <em>Finally</em>, but was ignored if an exception had been thrown.</p>
<p><em>Finally</em> statements are not executed if the script is directly terminated by any means, including the tray menu, <a href="ExitApp.htm">ExitApp</a>, or <a href="Exit.htm">Exit</a> (when the script is not <a href="_Persistent.htm">persistent</a>). However, if only the current <a href="../misc/Threads.htm">thread</a> (not the entire script) is exiting, <em>Finally</em> statements are executed.</p>
<p>The <a href="Block.htm#otb">One True Brace (OTB) style</a> may optionally be used with <em>Finally</em>. For example:</p>
<pre>try {
    ...
} finally {
    ...
}

try {
    ...
} catch e {
    ...
} finally {
    ...
}</pre>
