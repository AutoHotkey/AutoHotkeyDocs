# Documentation for AutoHotkey_L



## Auto... what?



AutoHotkey (AHK) is a scripting language for the Windows operating system.  It specializes in 
automation.  What would take hundreds of lines in another language can be done in as little as 1 with AHK.

## What can I find here?

These pages cover how to use AutoHotkey.  Some cover the many built-in functions of AutoHotkey.  Others are resources such as the list of keys, and their names.  For more depth, you can also find tutorials.

Wherever you look there will be examples â€“ usually at  the bottom of a page.

## I don't speak HTML...

We don't expect you to!  These docs are available in a number of human readable formats.

When you download AutoHotkey, a copy of *AutoHotkey.chm* is included.  It's a compiled version of these very docs.

You can find them online in two places.  They are [*autohotkey.net*](http://l.autohotkey.net/) and [right here](http://lexikos.github.com/AutoHotkey_L-Docs/docs/AutoHotkey.htm) on GitHub.

In the open source nature of AutoHotkey, the source can be found as well.  You should be able to drag and drop *index.htm* into your favorite browser.  This leads me to the next question you **must** be asking.

## Great!  How do I help?

If you have any improvements in mind, we'd love em!  Clone the repo and make your changes.  When done, give a nice descriptive commit message, and push it on up.  Send Lexikos a pull request, and there's a good chance of it being accepted.

You could, instead, post your changes [here](http://www.autohotkey.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=501793#501793), if you're not familiar with `git`.
